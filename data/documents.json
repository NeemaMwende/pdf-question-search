Be ye warned.\n\nThis isn't the way they normally do it.\nSam pulls against the ropes, a fine trembling starting in his arms as he grits his teeth a little,\ntests the strength of his bonds. They don't give very much-- his arms are pulled tight to the\nbed, and his legs are just loose enough that he can bend his knees a little. Not that it does him\nany good. Sam isn't going anywhere, not anytime soon.\nHe can't seem to stop himself from getting worked up by that thought, breath coming faster\nas he grows frustratedly hard, straining against the material of his jeans, gasping when the\nmovement of his hips makes his jeans shift a little, rubbing his cock. This is dangerous--\nHell, this is stupid and he knows it. He's helpless in this position, vulnerable, things no hunter\ncan afford to be. Anyone could come in and find him. Anyone could take advantage of this.\nThat's why it's both a comfort and a torment to have Dean sitting across the motel room in\none of the narrow desk chairs, watching him.\nDean sits, chin in hand and eyes far too intent. He acts like he can just watch for as long as he\nlikes while Sam writhes, tugs at the ropes, moans miserably when they won't give. He acts\nlike he's got all fucking night to watch this show and he intends to get his money's worth.\nSam groans. \"Dean, you bastard.\" He keeps writhing, mostly because he can't not, not with\nDean watching him like that, and his dick is driving him crazy, crazy good, and he might just\nlose it this way. He can't help his own startled jerk at that thought; wetness smears the inside\nof his jeans like a future promise.\nAnd Dean watches, just this side of smug now. Damn him, he has to know that Sam's on the\nverge of coming without a hand on him, that just knowing Dean is over there getting off on\nthe way he looks is almost enough to send him over the edge all on his own. Except it's not\nenough, not what he wants-- not Dean, and it chafes too, dammit.\nSo maybe he starts begging for it. \"Dean, Dean. C'mon, please.\" Sam can feel his face go hot,\nshame and arousal mixing dizzily in his brain. Dean slides out of his chair to stalk closer, to\nstand over his brother and stare down at him as he writhes, lips pulled into a wide smirk, but\nhis eyes are so intense, hot and dark, the green swallowed up by his pupils blown wide.\nDean reaches out and slides a finger-- just one finger-- down Sam's leg, from knee to thigh,\ntracing the heavy inseam of his jeans.\nSam shudders hard, all of him tuning into that single point of contact, lets his eyes flutter\nclosed. Something so innocuous shouldn't feel so intense, shouldn't make him want so badly\nthat he's willing to beg again, promise anything, anything, just so Dean will touch him more.\nHe has to clear his throat twice just to rasp, \"God, Dean, please.\" Dean smiles, bright and\nwicked.\nAnd then just like that, the contact is gone. Sam keens in his throat, straining upward to find\nit again.\n\nDean sounds sort of awed as he stares down. \"Sam, Sammy. You don't know how good you\nlook like this. Fuck.\"\nSam spreads his legs just that fraction wider that the ropes allow, all desperate invitation.\nDean, Dean. You know you can have it. The waiting is driving him out of his head. He lets his\neyes go heavy and he breathes out, \"Dean, now.\" Not forcefully, not even a command, but\nwhatever it is Dean reads in his face, it's enough to make him slide onto the bed and lean\ndown to catch Sam's mouth in a hard and breathless kiss.\nSam is pliant at first, whimpering slightly, lips parting to let Dean lick into his mouth, fast\nand eager, and then he pushes up against him, wanting to feel as much as he can. His fingers\ntwitch with the need to feel Dean's hair between them, the short prickles and the rasp of the\nshorter stubble at the back of his neck, and something almost like anger heats in the pit of his\nstomach when his hands stay firmly tied and he can't. Dean shifts then, slides his body easily\nbetween Sam's spread legs, lets Sam take more of his weight as he settles there. Dean is hard,\noh god, Sam can feel it, and he suddenly couldn't give a fuck about Dean's hair, because he\ncan't give a fuck about anything, not when his mind is completely desperately blank.\nHe stops fighting then, all the struggle sliding out of him as he just goes loose and willing\nunder his brother. Dean notices the change, slides back just enough to whisper hot and wet\nagainst his mouth, \"Yeah, Sammy, that's it. You want this bad, don't you?\"\nSam can't even force out the words, so he just nods. Dean lowers himself back down to\nmouth at his throat-- Sam throws his head back, helplessly, pleadingly, hissing between his\nteeth when Dean follows up the sharp sting of a bite with the soothing wetness of his tongue.\nDean shifts a little farther down, following the line of Sam's throat, lips and tongue tracing\nover his adam's apple, which moves under his mouth as Sam sucks in another sharp breath.\nThe hollow between his clavicles catches Dean's attention next, followed by a long, wet, dirty\nlick along Sam's collarbones as if Dean wants to distract him from the hand that's working its\nway up under his shirt.\nSam can't decide if he's going nuts in a good way or a bad way, because he's so far past\nwanting foreplay, he just needs Dean, now, now. Then Dean's fingers beneath his shirt find\nhis nipple and twist, just so, and Sam can't stop the high, desperate sound that he makes.\nDean breathes out a hot gust against his skin. \"Fuck, Sam. You make those noises for me, and\nI--\" He doesn't finish the thought, just twists again, and then drags blunt nails slow and\ninexorable down Sam's ribs, making him squirm and thrust up mindlessly. He can't stop\npulling at the ropes-- Sam can feel them digging into his skin, but the rub and the ache is so\ndistant, so unimportant now.\n\"Dean,\" Sam breathes, panting so quick he almost sounds afraid. \"Dean, c'mon, please, just\nplease--\"\n\"Please what, Sam?\" As if he doesn't know.\nSam just whimpers, turns his face away, and Dean stops everything, leans up again,\nwhispering hot and urgent in his ear, \"Say it, Sam. More than anything right now I wanna\n\nhear you say it.\"\nSam trembles under him like he's going to fall apart, like he'll just shake himself to pieces\nthat Dean will gently put back together later. \"Dean,\" he whispers finally, voice nearly ruined,\n\"fuck me.\"\nDean smiles then, and the very small unclouded part of Sam's very preoccupied brain\nwonders how a Dean-smile can be so dirty and so tender at the same time. \"No.\"\n\"What?\" Sam's brain refuses to shift gears and splutters out by the roadside. He jerks under\nDean, mindlessly. \"Dean, you have to, god, don't do this to me--\"\n\"Do what to you? Leave you like this? I totally could.\" His fingers trace down to Sam's wrist,\nskirting along the edges of the ropes feather-light. \"You're not goin' anywhere unless I let\nyou, Sammy.\"\n\"I know, I know.\" Sam feels dizzy, hot. More precome wets the inside of his jeans, and he's\ndesperate not to lose it like this. \"Anything, Dean, anything you want--\"\nDean shifts, crawling backward down his lap, fingers skimming their way down Sam's chest\nand stomach and then shoving his shirt up roughly. \"When you ask me so pretty,\" Dean\nmurmurs, almost like he's talking to himself, \"how can I say no?\" His hands start working on\nthe buttons of Sam's jeans, and Sam can only arch his back in frantic encouragement. Having\nDean's hands right there is almost too much already, and when Dean tugs the button open\nonly to stop there, Sam lets out a cry of frustration.\n\"Dean, fuck, Dean--\"\n\"Gonna come like this?\" Dean bends himself low, till his mouth is hovering over the tight\nbulge in Sam's jeans. \"Gonna spill right in your pants for me, Sammy?\" His lips tilt sideways.\n\"Maybe if you ask real nice, I'll lick you clean after.\"\nSam closes his eyes, breathes fast and desperate as Dean lowers that last inch and mouths at\nthe front of his pants. Warmth seeps through the material, warmth and wetness and then\npressure as Dean sucks at him hard right through the cotton.\n\"Ohgod ohgod ohgod--\" It's too much. The unending tease takes its toll, finally, and Sam can\nonly ride it as he comes, gasping and writhing and spitting Dean's name. His cock jerks,\nspilling hotly, come soaking into his unbuttoned jeans, and it's the worst and also the best\nthing he's felt in a long, long time.\nReality filters back slowly. Sam shakes his head, trying to dislodge some of the hair sticking\ndamply to his forehead. Up above the ceiling comes gradually into focus, and it's an attempt\nto get his breathing back under control that has Sam counting the cracks in the plaster.\n\"Can't believe you really creamed your pants,\" Dean says, sounding way too fucking pleased.\nSam lifts his head to glare at his brother, but the expression just takes too much effort,\nespecially when Dean starts tracing his fingers over the wet patch of his jeans. He lets his\nhead flop back to the pillows, groaning miserably.\n\n\"Jerk. All your fault,\" he rasps.\nDean hums out a pleased sound and starts on Sam's zipper. \"Guess I can take responsibility\nfor this one.\"\nSam shudders hard-- the contact is too much, too soon. \"Nnh, Dean, what're you--\"\n\"Promised to lick you clean, didn't I? I'm gonna.\"\nWay too much, way too soon. Something too sharp to be arousal but too good to be anything\nelse sparks its way up Sam's spine. \"Dean, wait, what about you?\"\nDean laughs, warm and self-satisfied like when he knows what he's going to get and it's a\nsure thing. \"I'm gonna lick you hard again, Sammy,\" he says, voice sliding low and dark,\n\"and when you're ready for me again I'm gonna ride you till we both come.\"\nSam thinks it's the best idea either of them has had all night.\n\nPlease drop by the Archive and comment to let the creator know if you enjoyed their work!",

      "text": "\n\n \n   \nArtificial Intelligence/ \nMachine Learning Explained \nGordian Knot Center for \nNational Security Innovation \nAuthor: Steve Blank \nhttps://gordianknot.stanford.edu \n\n \nArtificial Intelligence/Machine Learning– Explained \n \nAI is a once-in-a lifetime commercial and defense game changer \n \nHundreds of billions in public and private capital is being invested in AI and Machine Learning \ncompanies. The number of patents filed in 2021 is more than 30 times higher than in 2015 as \ncompanies and countries across the world have realized that AI and Machine Learning will be a \nmajor disruptor and potentially change the balance of military power.  \n \nUntil recently, the hype exceeded reality. Today, however, advances in AI in several important \nareas (here, here, here, here and here) equal and even surpass human capabilities.   \n \nIf you haven’t paid attention, now’s the time.  \n \nAI and the DoD \nThe Department of Defense has thought that AI is such a foundational set of technologies that \nthey started a dedicated organization- the JAIC - to enable and implement artificial intelligence \nacross the Department. They provide the infrastructure, tools, and technical expertise for DoD \nusers to successfully build and deploy their AI-accelerated projects. \n \nSome specific defense related AI applications are listed later in this document. \n \nWe’re in the Middle of a Revolution \nImagine it’s 1950, and you’re a visitor who traveled back in time from today. Your job is to \nexplain the impact computers will have on business, defense and society to people who are \nusing manual calculators and slide rules. You succeed in convincing one company and a \ngovernment to adopt computers and learn to code much faster than their competitors \n/adversaries. And they figure out how they could digitally enable their business – supply chain, \ncustomer interactions, etc. Think about the competitive edge they’d have by today in business \nor as a nation. They’d steamroll everyone. \n \nThat’s where we are today with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. These technologies \nwill transform businesses and government agencies. Today, 100s of billions of dollars in private \ncapital have been invested in 1,000s of AI startups. The U.S. Department of Defense has created \na dedicated organization to ensure its deployment. \n \nBut What Is It? \nCompared to the classic computing we’ve had for the last 75 years, AI has led to new types of \napplications, e.g. facial recognition; new types of algorithms, e.g. machine learning; new types \nof computer architectures,  e.g. neural nets; new hardware, e.g. GPUs; new types of software \ndevelopers, e.g. data scientists; all under the overarching theme of artificial intelligence. The \nsum of these feels like buzzword bingo. But they herald a sea change in what computers are \ncapable of doing, how they do it, and what hardware and software is needed to do it. \n\n \n \nThis brief will attempt to describe all of it. \n \nNew Words to Define Old Things \nOne of the reasons the world of AI/ML is confusing is that it’s created its own language and \nvocabulary. It uses new words to define programming steps, job descriptions, development \ntools, etc. But once you understand how the new world maps onto the classic computing world, \nit starts to make sense. So first a short list of some key definitions. \n \nAI/ML - a shorthand for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) - a catchall term used to describe “Intelligent machines” which can \nsolve problems, make/suggest decisions and perform tasks that have traditionally required \nhumans to do. AI is not a single thing, but a constellation of different technologies.  \n \nMachine Learning (ML) - a subfield of \nartificial intelligence. Humans \ncombine data with algorithms (see \nhere for a list) to train a model using \nthat data. This trained model can \nthen make predications on new data \n(is this picture a cat, a dog or a \nperson?) or decision-making \nprocesses (like understanding text \nand images) without being explicitly \nprogrammed to do so.  \n \nMachine learning algorithms - computer programs that adjust themselves to perform \nbetter as they are exposed to more data. The “learning” part of machine learning means \nthese programs change how they process data over time. In other words, a machine-\nlearning algorithm can adjust its own settings, given feedback on its previous \nperformance in making predictions about a collection of data (images, text, etc.).  \n \nDeep Learning/Neural Nets – a subfield of machine learning. Neural networks make up the \nbackbone of deep learning. (The “deep” in deep learning \nrefers to the depth of layers in a neural network.) Neural \nnets are effective at a variety of tasks (e.g., image \nclassification, speech recognition). A deep learning neural \nnet algorithm is given massive volumes of data, and a task to \nperform - such as classification. The resulting model is \ncapable of solving complex tasks such as recognizing objects \nwithin an image and translating speech in real time. In \nreality, the neural net is a logical concept that gets mapped \nonto a physical set of specialized processors. See here.) \n\n \nData Science – a new field of computer science. Broadly it encompasses data systems and \nprocesses aimed at maintaining data sets and deriving meaning out of them. In the context of \nAI, it’s the practice of people who are doing machine learning. \n \nData Scientists - responsible for extracting insights that help businesses make decisions. \nThey explore and analyze data using machine learning platforms to create models about \ncustomers, processes, risks, or whatever they’re trying to predict. \n \nWhat’s Different? Why is Machine Learning Possible Now? \nTo understand why AI/Machine Learning can do these things, let’s compare them to computers \nbefore AI came on the scene. (Warning – simplified examples below.) \n \nClassic Computers \nFor the last 75 years computers (we’ll call these classic computers) have both shrunk to pocket \nsize (iPhones) and grown to the size of warehouses (cloud data centers), yet they all continued \nto operate essentially the same way. \n \nClassic Computers - Programming \nClassic computers are designed to do anything a human explicitly tells them to do. People \n(programmers) write software code (programming) to develop applications, thinking a priori \nabout all the rules, logic and knowledge that need to be built in to an application so that it can \ndeliver a specific result. These rules are explicitly coded into a program using a software \nlanguage (Python, JavaScript, C#, Rust, ...).  \n \nClassic Computers -  Compiling \nThe code is then compiled using software to translate the programmer’s source code into a \nversion that can be run on a target computer/browser/phone. For most of today’s programs, \nthe computer used to develop and compile the code does not have to be that much faster than \nthe one that will run it. \n\n \n \nClassic Computers - Running/Executing Programs \nOnce a program is coded and compiled, it can be deployed and run (executed) on a desktop \ncomputer, phone, in a browser window, a data center cluster, in special hardware, etc. \nPrograms/applications can be games, social media, office applications, missile guidance \nsystems, bitcoin mining, or even operating systems e.g. Linux, Windows, IOS. These programs \nrun on the same type of classic computer architectures they were programmed in.  \n \nClassic Computers – Software Updates, New Features  \nFor programs written for classic computers, software developers receive bug reports, monitor \nfor security breaches, and send out regular software updates that fix bugs, increase \nperformance and at times add new features.  \n \nClassic Computers-  Hardware \nThe CPUs (Central Processing Units) that write and run these Classic Computer applications all \nhave the same basic design (architecture). The CPUs are designed to handle a wide range \nof tasks quickly in a serial fashion. These CPUs range from Intel X86 chips, and the ARM cores \non Apple M1 SoC, to the z15 in IBM mainframes. \n \nMachine Learning \nIn contrast to programming on classic computing with fixed rules, machine learning is just like it \nsounds – we can train/teach a computer to “learn by example” by feeding it lots and lots of \nexamples. (For images a rule of thumb is that a machine learning algorithm needs at least 5,000 \nlabeled examples of each category in order to produce an AI model with decent performance.) \nOnce it is trained, the computer runs on its own and can make predictions and/or complex \ndecisions.   \n \nJust as traditional programming has three steps - first coding a program, next compiling it and \nthen running it  - machine learning also has three steps: training (teaching), pruning and \ninference (predicting by itself.)  \n \n\n \nMachine Learning - Training \nUnlike programing classic computers with explicit rules, training is the process of “teaching” a \ncomputer to perform a task e.g. recognize faces, signals, understand text, etc. (Now you know \nwhy you're asked to click on images of traffic lights, cross walks, stop signs, and buses or type \nthe text of scanned image in ReCaptcha.) Humans provide massive volumes of “training data” \n(the more data, the better the model’s performance) and select the appropriate algorithm to \nfind the best optimized outcome.  \n(See the detailed “machine learning pipeline” later in this section for the gory details.) \n \n  \nBy running an algorithm selected by a data scientist on a set of training data, the Machine \nLearning system generates the rules embedded in a trained model. The system learns from \nexamples (training data), rather than being explicitly programmed. (See the “Types of Machine \nLearning” section for more detail.) This self-correction is pretty cool. An input to a neural net \nresults in a guess about what that input is. The neural net then takes its guess and compares it \nto a ground-truth about the data, effectively asking an expert “Did I get this right?” The \ndifference between the network’s guess and the ground truth is its error. The network \nmeasures that error, and walks the error back over its model, adjusting weights to the extent \nthat they contributed to the error.) \n \nJust to make the point again: The algorithms combined with the training data - not external \nhuman computer programmers - create the rules that the AI uses. The resulting model is \ncapable of solving complex tasks such as recognizing objects it’s never seen before, translating \ntext or speech, or controlling a drone swarm.   \n \n\n \n(Instead of building a model from scratch you can now buy, for common machine learning \ntasks, pretrained models from others and here, much like chip designers buying IP Cores.) \n \nMachine Learning Training - Hardware  \nTraining a machine learning model is a very computationally intensive task. AI hardware must \nbe able to perform thousands of multiplications and additions in a mathematical process called \nmatrix multiplication. It requires specialized chips to run fast. (See the AI hardware section for \ndetails.)  \n \nMachine Learning - Simplification via pruning, quantization, distillation \nJust like classic computer code needs to be compiled and optimized before it is deployed on its \ntarget hardware, the machine learning models are simplified and modified (pruned) to use less \ncomputing power, energy, and  memory before they’re deployed to run on their hardware. \n \nMachine Learning – Inference Phase \nOnce the system has been trained it can be copied to other devices and run. And the computing \nhardware can now make inferences (predictions) on new data that the model has never \nseen before.  \n \nInference can even occur locally on edge devices where physical devices meet the digital world \n(routers, sensors, IOT devices), close to the source of where the data is generated. This reduces \nnetwork bandwidth issues and eliminates latency issues.  \n \nMachine Learning Inference - Hardware  \nInference (running the model) requires substantially less compute power than training. But \ninference also benefits from specialized AI chips. \n \nMachine Learning – Performance Monitoring and Retraining  \nJust like classic computers where software developers do regular software updates to fix bugs \nand increase performance and add features, machine learning models also need to be updated \nregularly by adding new data to the old training pipelines and running them again. Why?  \n\n \n \nOver time machine learning models get stale. Their real-world performance generally degrades \nover time if they are not updated regularly with new training data that matches the changing \nstate of the world. The models need to be monitored and retrained regularly for data and/or \nconcept drift, harmful predictions, performance drops, etc. To stay up to date, the models need \nto re-learn the patterns by looking at the most recent data that better reflects reality.  \n \nOne Last Thing – “Verifiability/Explainability” \nUnderstanding how an AI works is essential to fostering trust and confidence in AI production \nmodels. \n \nNeural Networks and Deep Learning differ from other types of Machine Learning algorithms in \nthat they have low explainability. They can generate a prediction, but it is very difficult to \nunderstand or explain how it arrived at its prediction. This “explainability problem” is often \ndescribed as a problem for all of AI, but it’s primarily a problem for Neural Networks and Deep \nLearning. Other types of Machine Learning algorithms – for example decision trees – have very \nhigh explainability. The results of the five-year DARPA Explainable AI Program (XAI) are worth \nreading here. \n \n \n \nSo   What Can Machine Learning Do?\n1\n \nIt’s taken decades but as of today, on its simplest implementations, machine learning \napplications can do some tasks better and/or faster than humans.\n Machine Learning is most \nadvanced and widely applied today in processing text (through Natural Language Processing) \n \n1\n https://databricks.com/discover/pages/the-democratization-of-artificial-intelligence-and-  deep  -learning \n\n \nfollowed by understanding images and videos (through Computer Vision) and analytics and \nanomaly detection. For example: \n \nRecognize and Understand Text/Natural Language Processing \nAI is better than humans on basic reading comprehension benchmarks like SuperGLUE and \nSQuAD and their performance on complex linguistic tasks is almost there. Applications: GPT-3, \nM6, OPT-175B, Google Translate, Gmail Autocomplete, Chatbots, Text summarization.  \n \nWrite Human-like Answers to Questions and Assist in Writing Computer Code \nAn AI can write original text that is indistinguishable from that created by humans. Examples \nGPT-3, Wu Dao 2.0 or generate computer code. Example GitHub Copilot, Wordtune \n \nRecognize and Understand Images and video streams \nAn AI can see and understand what it sees. It can identify and detect an object or a \nfeature in an image or video. It can even identify faces. It can scan news broadcasts \nor read and assess text that appears in videos. It has uses in threat detection -  \nairport security, banks, and sporting events. In medicine to interpret MRI’s or to \ndesign drugs. And in retail to scan and analyze in-store imagery to intuitively determine \ninventory movement. Examples of ImageNet benchmarks here and here \n \nDetect Changes in Patterns/Recognize Anomalies \nAn AI can recognize patterns which don’t match the behaviors expected for a \nparticular system, out of millions of different inputs or transactions. These \napplications can discover evidence of an attack on financial networks, fraud \ndetection in insurance filings or credit card purchases; identify fake reviews; even tag \nsensor data in industrial facilities that mean there’s a safety issue. Examples here, here and \nhere.  \n \n Power Recommendation Engines \n An AI can provide recommendations based on user behaviors used in ecommerce \nto provide accurate suggestions of products to users for future purchases based on \ntheir shopping history. Examples: Alexa and Siri\n \n \nRecognize and Understand Your Voice \nAn AI can understand spoken language. Then it can comprehend what is being said and in what \ncontext. This can enable chatbots to have a conversation with \npeople. It can record and transcribe meetings. (Some versions can \neven read lips to increase accuracy.) Examples: Siri/Alexa/Google \nAssistant. Example here \n \nCreate Artificial Images \nAI can create artificial images (DeepFakes) that are \nindistinguishable from real ones using Generative Adversarial \n\n \nNetworks. Useful in entertainment, virtual worlds, gaming, fashion design, etc. Synthetic faces \nare now indistinguishable and more trustworthy than photos of real people. Paper here. \n \nCreate Artist Quality Illustrations from A Written Description  \nAI can generate images from text descriptions, creating anthropomorphized versions of animals \nand objects, combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways. An example is Dall-E \n \nGenerative Design of Physical Products  \nEngineers can input design goals into AI-driven generative design software, along with \nparameters such as performance or spatial requirements, materials, manufacturing methods, \nand cost constraints. The software explores all the possible permutations of a solution, quickly \ngenerating design alternatives Example here.   \n \nSentiment Analysis \nAn AI leverages deep natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics \nto gain insight into customer opinion, understanding of consumer sentiment, and \nmeasuring the impact of marketing strategies. Examples: Brand24, MonkeyLearn \n \n \n \nWhat Does this Mean for Businesses? \nSkip this section if you’re interested in national security applications \n \nHang on to your seat. We’re just at the beginning of the revolution. The next phase of AI, \npowered by ever increasing powerful AI hardware and cloud clusters, will combine some of \nthese basic algorithms into applications that do things no human can. It will transform business \nand defense in ways that will create new applications and opportunities.  \n \nHuman-Machine Teaming \nApplications with embedded intelligence have already begun to appear thanks to massive \nlanguage models. For example - Copilot as a pair-programmer in Microsoft Visual Studio \nVSCode. It’s not hard to imagine DALL-E 2 as an illustration assistant in a photo editing \napplication, or GPT-3 as a writing assistant in Google Docs. \n  \nAI in Medicine \nAI applications are already appearing in radiology, dermatology, and oncology. Examples: IDx-\nDR, OsteoDetect, Embrace2.  AI Medical image identification can automatically detect lesions, \nand tumors with diagnostics equal to or greater than humans. For Pharma, AI will power drug \ndiscovery design for finding new drug candidates. The FDA has a plan for approving AI software \nhere has a list of AI-enabled medical devices here. \n \n\n \nAutonomous Vehicles \nHarder than it first seemed, but car companies like Tesla will eventually get better than human \nautonomy for highway driving and eventually city streets. \n \nDecision support \nAdvanced virtual assistants can listen to and observe behaviors, build and maintain data \nmodels, and predict and recommend actions to assist people with and automate tasks that \nwere previously only possible for humans to accomplish. \n \nSupply chain management \nAI applications are already appearing in predictive maintenance, risk management, \nprocurement, order fulfillment, supply chain planning and promotion management. \n \nMarketing  \nAI applications are already appearing in real-time personalization, content and media \noptimization and campaign orchestration to augment, streamline and automate marketing \nprocesses and tasks constrained by human costs and capability, and to uncover new customer \ninsights and accelerate deployment at scale. \n \nMaking business smarter: Customer Support \nAI applications are already appearing in virtual customer assistants with speech recognition, \nsentiment analysis, automated/augmented quality assurance and other technologies providing \ncustomers with 24/7 self- and assisted-service options across channels. \n \nAI in  National Security\n2\n \nMuch like the dual-use/dual-nature of classical computers AI developed for commercial \napplications can also be used for national security.  \n \nAI/ML and Ubiquitous Technical Surveillance \nAI/ML have made most cities untenable for traditional \ntradecraft. Machine learning can integrate travel data \n(customs, airline, train, car rental, hotel, license plate \nreaders...,) integrate feeds from CCTV cameras for facial \nrecognition and gait recognition, breadcrumbs from wireless \ndevices and then combine it with DNA sampling. The result \nis automated persistent surveillance. \n \nChina’s employment of AI as a tool of repression and \nsurveillance of the Uyghurs is a dystopian of how a totalitarian regimes will use AI-enable \nubiquitous surveillance to repress and monitor its own populace. \n \n \n2\n https://www.nscai.gov/2021-final-report/ \n\n \nAI/ML on the Battlefield \nAI will enable new levels of performance and autonomy for weapon systems. Autonomously \ncollaborating assets (e.g., drone swarms, ground vehicles) that can coordinate attacks, ISR \nmissions, & more.  \n \nFusing and making sense of sensor data (detecting threats in optical /SAR imagery, classifying \naircraft based on radar returns, searching for anomalies in radio frequency signatures, etc.) \nMachine learning is better and faster than humans in finding targets hidden in a high-clutter \nbackground. Automated target detection and fires from satellite/UAV.  \n \nFor example, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or Unmanned Ground Vehicles with on board \nAI edge computers could use deep learning to detect and locate concealed chemical, biological \nand explosives threats by fusing imaging sensors and chemical/biological sensors.  \nOther examples include:  \n \nUse AI/ML countermeasures against adversarial, low probability of intercept/low probability of \ndetection (LPI/LPD) radar techniques in radar and communication systems. \n \nGiven sequences of observations of unknown radar waveforms from arbitrary emitters without \na priori knowledge, use machine learning to develop behavioral models to enable inference of \nradar intent and threat level, and to enable prediction of future behaviors.  \n \nFor objects in space, use machine learning to predict and characterize a spacecrafts possible \nactions, its subsequent trajectory, and what threats it can pose from along that trajectory. \nPredict the outcomes of finite burn, continuous thrust, and impulsive maneuvers. \n \nAI empowers other applications such as: \n• Flight Operations Planning Decision Aid Tool for Strike Operations Aboard Aircraft \nCarriers \n• Automated Battle management – air and missile defense, army/navy tactical... \n \nAI/ML in Collection  \nThe front end of intelligence collection platforms has created a firehose of data that have \noverwhelmed human analysts. “Smart” sensors coupled with inference engines that can pre-\nprocess raw intelligence and prioritize what data to transmit and store –helpful in degraded or \nlow-bandwidth environments. \n \nHuman-Machine Teaming in Signals Intelligence \nApplications with embedded intelligence have already begun to appear in commercial \napplications thanks to massive language models. For example - Copilot as a pair-programmer in \n\n \nMicrosoft Visual Studio VSCode. It’s not hard to imagine an AI \nthat can detect and isolate anomalies and other patterns of \ninterest in all sorts of signal data faster and more reliably \nthan human operators.  \n \nAI-enabled natural language processing, computer vision, \nand audiovisual analysis can vastly reduce manual data \nprocessing. Advances in speech-to-text transcription and \nlanguage analytics now enable reading comprehension, \nquestion answering, and automated summarization of large quantities of text. This not only \nprioritizes the work of human analysts, it’s a major force multiplier \n \nAI can also be used to automate data conversion such as translations and decryptions, \naccelerating the ability to derive actionable insights. \n \nHuman-Machine Teaming in Tasking and Dissemination \nAI-enabled systems will automate and optimize tasking and collection for platforms, sensors, \nand assets in near-real time in response to dynamic intelligence requirements or changes in the \nenvironment.  \n \nAI will be able to automatically generate machine-readable versions of intelligence products \nand disseminate them at machine speed so that computer systems across the IC and the \nmilitary can ingest and use them in real time without manual intervention. \n \nHuman-Machine Teaming in Exploitation and Analytics \nAI-enabled tools can augment filtering, flagging, and triage across multiple data sets. They can \nidentify connections and correlations more efficiently and at a greater scale than human \nanalysts, and can flag those findings and the most important content for human analysis. \nAI can fuse data from multiple sources, types of intelligence, and classification levels to produce \naccurate predictive analysis in a way that is not currently possible. This can improve indications \nand warnings for military operations and active cyber defense. \n \nAI/ML Information warfare \nNation states have used AI systems to enhance disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks. \nThis included using “DeepFakes” (fake videos generated by a neural network that are nearly \nindistinguishable from reality). They are harvesting data on Americans to build profiles of our \nbeliefs, behavior, and biological makeup for tailored attempts to manipulate or coerce \nindividuals.  \n \nBut because a large percentage of it is open-source AI is not limited to nation states, AI-\npowered cyber-attacks, deepfakes and AI software paired with commercially available drones \ncan create “poor-man’s smart weapons” for use by rogue states, terrorists and criminals. \n\n \n \nAI/ML Cyberwarfare  \nAI-enabled malware can learn and adapt to a system’s defensive measures, or, conversely, AI-\nenabled cyber-defensive tools can proactively locate and address network anomalies and \nsystem vulnerabilities. \n \n \n \nAI-driven malware, where a malicious logic embeds machine learning methods and models to \nautomatically: (i) probe the target system for inferring \nactionable intelligence (e.g. system configuration or \noperational patterns) and (ii) customize the attack \npayload accordingly (e.g. determine the most opportune \ntime to execute the payload so to maximize the impact).  \n \nAttacks Against AI - Adversarial AI \nAs AI proliferates, defeating adversaries will be predicated on defeating their AI and vice versa. \nAs Neural Networks take over sensor processing and triage tasks, a human may only be alerted \nif the AI deems it suspicious. Therefore, we only need to defeat the AI to evade detection, not \nnecessarily a human.  \n \nAdversarial attacks against AI fall into three types: \n• Data misclassification- to generate false positive or negative results \n• Synthetic data generation-to feed false information  \n• Data analysis – for AI-assisted classical attack generation \n \nAI Attack Surfaces \nElectronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP), Electronic Support (ES) all have analogues in \nthe AI algorithmic domain. In the future, we may play the same game about the “Algorithmic \nSpectrum,” denying our adversaries their AI capabilities while defending ours. Other can steal \nor poison our models  or manipulate our training data. \nAI –Friend or Foe?\nCHAPTER 1\n45\np\n5IF\u00036\u000f4\u000f\u0003HPWFSONFOU\u0003JT\u0003OPU\u0003QSFQBSFE\u0003UP\u0003EFGFOE\u0003UIF\u00036OJUFE\u00034UBUFT\u0003JO\u0003UIF\u0003\nDPNJOH\u0003BSUJmDJBM\u0003JOUFMMJHFODF\u0003\t\"*\n\u0003FSB\u000f\u0003\"*\u0003BQQMJDBUJPOT\u0003BSF\u0003USBOTGPSNJOH\u0003\nexisting threats, creating new classes of threats, and further emboldening \nstate  and  non-state  adversaries  to  exploit  vulnerabilities  in  our  open \nsociety.\n1\n AI systems will extend the range and reach of adversaries into \nUIF\u00036OJUFE\u00034UBUFT\u0003KVTU\u0003BT\u0003UIF\u0003NJTTJMF\u0003BHF\u0003BOE\u0003UFSSPSJTN\u0003CSPVHIU\u0003UISFBUT\u0003\ncloser  to  home.

Massive Data Sets \n2. Improved Machine Learning algorithms  \n3. Open-Source Code, Pretrained Models and \nFrameworks \n4. More computing power \n \nMassive Data Sets \nMachine Learning algorithms tend to require large quantities of training data in order to \nproduce high-performance AI models. (Training Google’s GPT-3 Natural Language Model with \n175 billion parameters takes 1,024 Nvidia A100 GPUs more than one month.) Today, strategic \nand tactical sensors pour in a firehose of images, signals and other data. Billions of computers, \ndigital devices and sensors connected to the Internet, producing and storing large volumes of \ndata, which provide other sources of intelligence. For example facial recognition requires \nmillions of labeled images of faces for training data. \n \nOf course more data only helps if the data is relevant to your desired application. Training data \nneeds to match the real-world operational data very, very closely to train a high-performing AI \nmodel. \n \nImproved Machine Learning algorithms  \nThe first Machine Learning algorithms are decades old, and some remain incredibly useful. \nHowever, researchers have discovered new algorithms that have greatly sped up the fields \ncutting-edge. These new algorithms have made Machine Learning models more flexible, more \nrobust, and more capable of solving different types of problems. \n \nOpen-Source Code, Pretrained Models and Frameworks \nDeveloping Machine Learning systems required a lot of expertise and custom software \ndevelopment that made it out of reach for most organizations. Now open-source code libraries \nand developer tools allow organizations to use and build upon the work of external \ncommunities. No team or organization has to start from scratch, and many parts that used to \nrequire highly specialized expertise have been automated. Even non-experts and beginners can \ncreate useful AI tools. In some cases, open-source ML models can be entirely reused and \npurchased. Combined with standard competitions, open source, pretrained models and \nframeworks have moved the field forward faster than any federal lab or contractor. It’s been a \nfeeding frenzy with the best and brightest researchers trying to one-up each other to prove \nwhich ideas are best. \n \n \n3\n https://www.ai.mil/docs/Understanding%20AI%20Technology.pdf \n\n \nThe downside is that, unlike past DoD technology development - where the DoD leads it, can \ncontrol it, and has the most advanced technology (like stealth and electronic warfare), in most \ncases the DoD will not have the most advanced algorithms or models. The analogy for AI is \ncloser to microelectronics than it is EW. The path forward for the DoD should be supporting \nopen research, but optimizing on data set collection, harvesting research results, and fast \napplication.  \n \nMore computing power – special chips \nMachine Learning systems require a lot of computing power. Today, it’s possible to run \nMachine Learning algorithms on massive datasets using commodity Graphics Processing Units \n(GPUs). (See the machine learning hardware section below). While many of the AI performance \nimprovements have been due to human cleverness on better models and algorithms, most of \nthe performance gains have been the massive increase in compute performance.  (See the \nsemiconductor section.)   \n \nMore computing power – AI In the Cloud \nThe rapid growth in the size of machine learning models has been achieved by the move to \nlarge data center clusters. The size of machine learning models are limited by time to train \nthem. For example, in training images, the size of the model scales with the number of pixels in \nan image. ImageNet Model sizes are 224x224 pixels. But HD (1920x1080) images require 40x \nmore computation/memory. Large Natural Language Processing models - e.g. summarizing \narticles, English-to-Chinese translation like Google’s GPT-3 require enormous models. GPT-3 \nuses 175 billion parameters and was trained on a cluster with 1,024 Nvidia A100 GPUs that cost \n~$25 million! (Which is why large clusters exist in the cloud, or the largest companies/ \ngovernment agencies.) Facebooks Deep Learning and Recommendation Model (DLRM) was \ntrained on 1TB data and has 24 billion parameters. Some cloud vendors train on >10TB data \nsets. \n \nInstead of investing in massive amounts of computers needed for training companies can use \nthe enormous on-demand, off-premises hardware in the cloud (e.g. Amazon AWS, Microsoft \nAzure) for both training machine learning models and deploying inferences.  \n \nWe’re Just Getting Started \nThe next 10 years will see a massive improvement on AI inference and training capabilities. This \nwill require regular refreshes of the hardware– on the chip and cloud clusters - to take \nadvantage. This is the AI version of Moore’s Law on steroids – applications that are completely \ninfeasible today will be easy in 5 years.  \n \nWhat Can’t AI Do?  \nWhile AI can do a lot of things better than humans when focused on a narrow objective, there \nare many things it still can’t do. AI works well in specific domain where you have lots of data, \ntime/resources to train, domain expertise to set the right goals/rewards during training, but \nthat is not always the case.  \n\n \n \nFor example AI models are only as good as the fidelity and quality of the training data. Having \nbad labels can wreak havoc on your training results. Protecting the integrity of the training data \nis critical.  \n \nIn addition, AI is easily fooled by out-of-domain data (things it hasn’t seen before). This can \nhappen by “overfitting” - when a model trains for too long on sample data or when the model is \ntoo complex, it can start to learn the “noise,” or irrelevant information, within the dataset.\n4\n \nWhen the model memorizes the noise and fits too closely to the training set, the model \nbecomes “overfitted,” and it is unable to generalize well to new data. If a model cannot \ngeneralize well to new data, then it will not be able to perform the classification or prediction \ntasks it was intended for. However, if you pause too early or exclude too many important \nfeatures, you may encounter the opposite problem, and instead, you may “underfit” your \nmodel. Underfitting occurs when the model has not trained for enough time, or the input \nvariables are not significant enough to determine a meaningful relationship between the input \nand output variables. \n \nAI is also poor at estimating uncertainty /confidence (and explaining its decision-making). It \ncan’t choose its own goals. (Executives need to define the decision that the AI will execute.  \nWithout well-defined decisions to be made, data scientists will waste time, energy and money.) \nExcept for simple cases an AI can’t (yet) figure out cause and effect or why something \nhappened. It can’t think creatively or apply common sense.  \n \nAI is not very good at creating a strategy (unless it can pull from previous examples and mimic \nthem, but then fails with the unexpected.) And it lacks generalized intelligence e.g. that can \ngeneralize knowledge and translate learning across domains.  \n \nAll of these are research topics actively being worked on. Solving these will take a combination \nof high-performance computing, advanced AI/ML semiconductors, creative machine learning \nimplementations and decision science. Some may be solved in the next decade, at least to a \nlevel where a human can’t tell the difference. \n \nWhere is AI in Business Going Next? \nSkip this section if you’re interested in national security applications \n \nJust as classic computers were applied to a broad set of business, science and military \napplications, AI is doing the same. AI is exploding not only in research and infrastructure (which \ngo wide) but also in the application of AI to vertical problems (which go deep and depend more \nthan ever on expertise). Some of the new applications on the horizon include Human \nAI/Teaming (AI helping in programming and decision making), smarter robotics and \nautonomous vehicles, AI-driven drug discovery and design, healthcare diagnostics, chip \nelectronic design automation, and basic science research.  \n \n4\n https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/overfitting \n\n \n \nAdvances in language understanding are being pursued to create systems that can summarize \ncomplex inputs and engage through human-like conversation, a critical component of next-\ngeneration teaming. \n \nWhere is AI and National Security Going Next? \nIn the near future AI may be able to predict the future actions an adversary could take and the \nactions a friendly force could take to counter these. The 20\nth\n century model loop of Observe–\nOrient–Decide and Act (OODA) is retrospective; an observation cannot be made until after the \nevent has occurred. An AI-enabled decision-making cycle might be ‘sense–predict–agree–act’: \nAI senses the environment; predicts what the adversary might do and offers what a future \nfriendly force response should be; the human part of the human–machine team agrees with \nthis assessment; and AI acts by sending machine-to-machine instructions to the small, agile and \nmany autonomous warfighting assets deployed en masse across the battlefield. \n \nAn example of this is DARPA’s ACE (Air Combat Evolution) program that is developing a \nwarfighting concept for combined arms using a manned and unmanned systems. Humans will \nfight in close collaboration with autonomous weapon systems in complex environments with \ntactics informed by artificial intelligence. \n \nA Once-in-a-Generation Event \nImagine it’s the 1980’s and you’re in charge of an intelligence agency. SIGINT and COMINT were \nanalog and RF. You had worldwide collection systems with bespoke systems in space, air, \nunderwater, etc. And you wake up to a world that shifts from copper to fiber. Most of your \npeople, and equipment and equipment are going to be obsolete, and you need to learn how to \ncapture those new bits. Almost every business processes needed to change, new organizations \nneeded to be created, new skills were needed, and old ones were obsoleted. That’s what AI/ML \nis going to do to you and your agency. \n \nThe primary obstacle to innovation in national security is not technology, it is culture. The DoD \nand IC must overcome a host of institutional, bureaucratic, and policy challenges to adopting \nand integrating these new technologies. Many parts of our culture are resistant to change, \nreliant on traditional tradecraft and means of collection, and averse to risk-taking, (particularly \nacquiring and adopting new technologies and integrating outside information sources.)  \n \nHistory tells us that late adopters fall by the wayside as more agile and opportunistic \ngovernments master new technologies. \n \nCarpe Diem. \n \nWant more Detail?   \nRead on if you want to know about Machine Learning chips, see a sample Machine Learning \nPipeline and learning about the four types of Machine Learning. \n\n \n \nArtificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Semiconductors \nSkip this section if all you need to know is that special chips are used for AI/ML. \n \nAI/ML, semiconductors, and high-performance computing are intimately intertwined  - and \nprogress in each is dependent on the others.  (See the “Semiconductor Ecosystem” report.) \n \nSome machine learning models can have trillions of parameters and require a massive number \nof specialized AI chips to run. Edge computers are significantly less powerful than the massive \ncompute power that’s located at data centers and the cloud. They need low power and \nspecialized silicon. \n \nWhy Dedicated AI Chips and Chip Speed Matter \nDedicated chips for neutral nets (e.g. Nvidia GPUs, Xilinx FPUs, Google TPUs) are faster than \nconventional CPUs for three reasons: 1) they use parallelization, 2) they \nhave larger memory bandwidth and 3) they have fast memory access. \n \nThere are three types of AI Chips: \n• Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) - Thousands of cores, parallel \nworkloads, widespread use in machine learning \n• Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)  - Good for algorithms; \ncompression, video encoding, cryptocurrency,  genomics, search. \nNeeds specialists to program, \n• Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) – custom chips e.g. \nGoogle TPU’s \n \nMatrix multiplication plays a big part in neural network computations, especially if there are \nmany layers and nodes. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) contain 100s or 1,000s of cores that \ncan do these multiplications simultaneously. And neural networks are inherently parallel which \nmeans that it’s easy to run a program across the cores and clusters of these processors. That \nmakes AI chips 10s or even 1,000s of times faster and more efficient than classic CPUs for \ntraining and inference of AI algorithms. State-of-the-art AI chips are dramatically more cost-\neffective than state-of-the-art CPUs as a result of their greater efficiency for AI algorithms. \n \nCutting-edge AI systems require not only AI-specific chips, but state-of-the-art AI chips. Older AI \nchips incur huge energy consumption costs that quickly balloon to unaffordable levels. Using \nolder AI chips today means overall costs and slowdowns at least an order of magnitude greater \nthan for state-of- the-art AI chips.  \n \n\n \nCost and speed make it virtually impossible to develop and deploy cutting-edge AI algorithms \nwithout state-of-the-art AI chips. Even with state-of-the-art AI chips, training a large AI \nalgorithm can cost tens of millions of dollars and take weeks to \ncomplete. With general-purpose chips like CPUs or older AI chips, \nthis training would take much longer and cost orders of \nmagnitude more, making staying at the R&D frontier impossible. \nSimilarly, performing inference using less advanced or less \nspecialized chips could involve similar cost overruns and take \norders of magnitude longer.  \n \nIn addition to off-the-shelf AI chips from Nvidia, Xlinix and Intel, large companies like Facebook, \nGoogle, Amazon, have designed their own chips to accelerate AI. The opportunity is so large \nthat there are hundreds of AI accelerator startups designing their own chips, funded by 10’s of \nbillions of venture capital and private equity. None of these companies own a chip \nmanufacturing plant (a fab) so they all use a foundry (an independent company that makes \nchips for others) like TSMC in Taiwan (or SMIC in China for Defense related silicon.) \n \nA Sample of AI GPU, FPGA and ASIC AI Chips and Where They’re Made \n \n \n \nIP (  Intellectual Property) Vendors Also Offer AI Accelerators  \nAI chip designers can buy AI IP Cores – prebuilt AI accelerators from Synopsys (EV7x,) Cadence \n(Tensilica AI,) Arm (Ethos,) Ceva (SensPro2, NeuPro),  Imagination (Series4,) ThinkSilicon (Neox,) \nFlexLogic (eFPGA,) Edgecortix and others.  \n \nOther AI Hardware Architectures \nSpiking Neural Networks (SNN) is a completely different approach from Deep Neural Nets. A \nform of Neuromorphic computing it tries to emulate how a brain works. SNN neurons use \n\n \nsimple counters and adder—no matrix multiply hardware is needed and power consumption is \nmuch lower. SNNs are good at unsupervised learning – e.g. detecting patterns in unlabeled data \nstreams. Combined with their low power they’re a good fit for sensors at the edge. Examples:: \nBrainChip, GrAI Matter, Innatera, Intel. \n \nAnalog Machine Learning AI chips use analog circuits to do the matrix multiplication in memory. \nThe result is extremely low power AI for always-on sensors. Examples: Mythic (AMP,) Aspinity \n(AML100,) Tetramem. \n \nOptical (Photonics) AI Computation promise performance gains over standard digital silicon, \nand some are nearing production. They use intersecting coherent light beams rather than \nswitching transistors to perform matrix multiplies. Computation happens in picoseconds and \nrequires only power for the laser. (Though off-chip digital transitions still limit power savings.) \nExamples: Lightmatter, Lightelligence, Luminous, Lighton. \n \nAI Hardware for the Edge \nAs more AI moves to the edge, the Edge AI accelerator market is segmenting into high-end \nchips for camera-based systems and low-power chips for simple sensors. For example:  \n \nAI Chips in Autonomous vehicles, Augmented Reality and multicamera surveillance systems \nThese inference engines require high performance. Examples: Nvidia (Orin,) AMD (Versal,) \nQualcomm (Cloud AI 100,) and acquired Arriver for automotive software. \n \nAI Chips in Cameras for facial recognition, surveillance. These inference chips require a balance \nof processing power with low power. Putting an AI chip in each camera reduces latency and \nbandwidth. Examples: Hailo-8, Ambarella CV5S,  Quadric (Q16), (RealTek 3916N). \n \nUltralow-Power AI Chips Target IoT Sensors - IoT devices require very simple neural networks \nand can run for years on a single battery. Example applications: Presence detection, wakeword \ndetection, gunshot detection... Examples: Syntiant (NDP,) Innatera, BrainChip,,  \n \nAI/ML Hardware Benchmarks \nWhile there are lots of claims about how much faster each of these chips are for AI/ML there \nare now a set of standard benchmarks -  MLCommons. These benchmarks were created by \nGoogle, Baidu, Stanford, Harvard and U.C. Berkeley. \n \nOne Last Thing - Non-Nvidia AI Chips and the “Nvidia Software Moat” \nNew AI accelerator chips most deal with the software moat that Nvidia has built around their \nGPU’s. As popular AI applications and frameworks are built on Nvidia CUDA software platform,  \nif new AI Accelerator vendors want to port these applications to their chips they have to build \ntheir own drivers, compiler, debugger, and other tools. \n \n\n \nDetails of a machine learning pipeline \nThis is a sample of the workflow (a pipeline) data scientists use to develop, deploy and maintain \na machine learning model (see the detailed description here.) \n \n \n \nThe Types of Machine Learning\n5\n – skip this section if you want to believe it’s \nmagic. \n \nMachine Learning algorithms fall into four classes: \n \n1. Supervised Learning \n2. Unsupervised Learning \n3. Semi-supervised Learning \n4. Reinforcement Learning \n \nThey differ based on: \n• What types of data their algorithms can work with \n• For  supervised and unsupervised learning, whether or not the training data is labeled or \nunlabeled \n• How the system receives its data inputs  \n \n \n5\n https://www.ai.mil/docs/Understanding%20AI%20Technology.pdf \n\n \nSupervised Learning \n• A “supervisor” (a human or a software system) accurately labels each of the training data \ninputs with its correct associated output \n• Note that pre-labeled data is only required for the training data that \nthe algorithm uses to train the AI mode \n• In operation in the inference phase the AI will be generating its own \nlabels, the accuracy of which will depend on the AI’s training  \n• Supervised Learning can achieve extremely high performance, but they require very large, \nlabeled datasets \n• Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time \n• For images a rule of thumb is that the algorithm needs at least 5,000 labeled examples of \neach category in order to produce an AI model with decent performance \n• In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively \nmaking predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer.  \n• While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning \nmodels, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. \n \nSupervised Machine Learning - Categories and Examples:  \n• Classification problems - use an algorithm to assign data into specific categories, such as \nseparating apples from oranges.

Some popular regression algorithms are linear \nregression, logistic regression and polynomial regression. \n• Example algorithms include: Logistic Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network \n \nUnsupervised Learning \n• These algorithms can analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. They discover hidden \npatterns in data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are “unsupervised”) \n• They can extract features from the data without a label for the results  \n• For an image classifier, an unsupervised algorithm would not identify the image as a “cat” \nor a “dog.” Instead, it would sort the training dataset into various groups based on their \nsimilarity \n• Unsupervised Learning systems are often less predictable, but as unlabeled data is usually \nmore available than labeled data, they are important \n• Unsupervised algorithms are useful when developers want to understand their own \ndatasets and see what properties might be useful in either developing automation or \nchange operational practices and policies \n• They still require some human intervention for validating the output  \n \n            Understanding Artificial Intelligence Technology \n \n Gregory C.

If you have an application where you think using AI could be beneficial, \nknowing whether or not any particular system that is claiming to use “AI” is using \nMachine Learning is  important  for several  reasons.  For  one  thing, Machine \nLearning works differently from traditional software, and it has different strengths \nand  weaknesses  too.  Moreover, Machine  Learning tends  to  break and  fail in \ndifferent ways. A basic understanding of these strengths, weaknesses, and failure \nmodes can help you understand whether or not your particular problems are a \ngood fit for a Machine Learning AI solution.  \n \nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING? HOW DO THEY DIFFER? \nLike Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning is also an umbrella term, and there \nare four different broad families of Machine Learning algorithms. There are also \nmany different subcategories and combinations under these four major families, \nbut  a  good  understanding  of  these four broad families will  be  sufficient  for  the \nvast majority of DoD employees, including senior leaders in non-technical roles.  \n \nThe four categories – \nexplained  more  on \nthe following page – \ndiffer based on what \ntypes  of  data  their \nalgorithms  can  work \nwith.   However, the \nimportant distinction \nis   not whether   the \ndata is audio, \nimages, text, or \nnumbers. Rather, the \nimportant  distinction \nis  whether  or  not  the  training  data  is  labeled or unlabeled  and  how  the  system \nreceives  its  data  inputs. Figure 3    provides  a  simple  illustration  of  labeled  and \nunlabeled training data for a classifier of images of cats and dogs. \n \nDepending upon whether or not data is labeled, a different family of algorithms \napplies. The four major   families   of   algorithms are   Supervised   Learning, \nUnsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. \n \nSupervised  Learning: “Supervised” means  that, before  the  algorithm  processes \nthe training data, some “supervisor” (which may be a human, group of humans, \nor  a  different  software  system)  has  accurately  labeled  each  of  the  data  inputs \n       Figure 3. Labeled and Unlabeled Training Data \n\n \nUnsupervised Machine Learning - Categories and Examples \n• Clustering groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. For example, K-\nmeans clustering algorithms assign similar data points into groups, where the K value \nrepresents the size of the grouping and granularity. This technique is helpful for market \nsegmentation, image compression, etc. \n• Association finds relationships between variables in a given dataset. These \nmethods are frequently used for market basket analysis and \nrecommendation engines, along the lines of “Customers Who Bought This \nItem Also Bought” recommendations. \n• Dimensionality reduction is used when the number of features  (or \ndimensions) in a given dataset is too high. It reduces the number of data \ninputs to a manageable size while also preserving the data integrity. Often, \nthis technique is used in the preprocessing data stage, such as when \nautoencoders remove noise from visual data to improve picture quality. \n• Example algorithms include: Apriori algorithm and K-Means \n \nDifference between supervised and unsupervised learning  \nThe main difference: Labeled data \n• Goals: In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new data. You know up \nfront the type of results to expect. With an unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to \nget insights from large volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is \ndifferent or interesting from the dataset. \n• Applications: Supervised learning models are ideal for spam detection, sentiment analysis, \nweather forecasting and pricing predictions, among other things. In contrast, unsupervised \nlearning is a great fit for anomaly detection, recommendation engines, customer personas \nand medical imaging. \n• Complexity: Supervised learning is a simple method for machine learning, typically \ncalculated through the use of programs like R or Python. In unsupervised learning, you need \npowerful tools for working with large amounts of unclassified data. Unsupervised learning \nmodels are computationally complex because they need a large training set to produce \nintended outcomes. \n• Drawbacks: Supervised learning models can be time-consuming to train, and the labels for \ninput and output variables require expertise. Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods \ncan have wildly inaccurate results unless you have human intervention to validate the \noutput variables. \n \nSemi-Supervised Learning \n• “Semi- Supervised” algorithms combine techniques from Supervised and Unsupervised \nalgorithms for applications with a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data.  \n• In practice, using them leads to exactly what you would expect, a mix of some of both of the \nstrengths and weaknesses of Supervised and Unsupervised approaches \n            Understanding Artificial Intelligence Technology \n \n Gregory C. Allen | DoD Joint AI Center \n13 \n13 \n \nFigure 4 depicts the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms \nusing an image analysis example. \n \nFigure 4. Illustrated Example of Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms \n \nIt  is  not  true  that  Unsupervised  Learning  is  “worse”  than  Supervised Learning \n(though  performance  can  be  lower  for some use  cases).  Rather, Unsupervised \nLearning is useful for solving different types of problems. A common Unsupervised \nuse  case  is  fraud  detection  in  financial  data. In  the  case  of  fraud  detection, \nSupervised  Learning  could  be  a  good  fit  for  identifying  potential  fraud  that \nmatches behaviors known to be unlawful or associated with fraud. Unsupervised \nLearning can find new, unidentified patterns of behavior that might indicate new \ntypes of fraud techniques. \n \n\n \n• Typical algorithms are extensions to other flexible methods that make assumptions about \nhow to model the unlabeled data. An example is \nGenerative Adversarial Networks trained on \nphotographs can generate new photographs that look \nauthentic to human observers (deep fakes)  \n \nReinforcement Learning \n• Training data is collected by an autonomous, self-directed AI agent as it perceives its \nenvironment and performs goal-directed actions  \n• The rewards are input data received by the AI agent \nwhen certain criteria are satisfied.  \n• These criteria are typically unknown to the agent at \nthe start of training \n• Rewards often contain only partial information. \nThey don’t signal which inputs were good or not \n• The system is learning to take actions to maximize its receipt of cumulative rewards \n• Reinforcement AI can defeat humans– in chess, Go...  \n• There are no labeled datasets for every possible move  \n• There is no assessment of whether it was a “good or bad move \n• Instead, partial labels reveal the final outcome “win” or “lose”  \n• The algorithms explore the space of possible actions to learn the optimal set of rules for \ndetermining the best action that maximize wins  \n \nReinforcement Machine Learning - Categories and Examples \n• Algorithm examples include: DQN (Deep Q Network), DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy \nGradient), A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Algorithm), NAF (Q-Learning with \nNormalized Advantage Functions), ... \n• AlphaGo, a Reinforcement system played 4.9 million \ngames of Go in 3 days against itself to learn how to \nplay the game at a world-champion level \n• Reinforcement is challenging to use in the real \nworld, as the real world is not as heavily bounded as \nvideo games and time cannot be sped up in the real \nworld \n• There are consequences to failure in the real world \n \nSources: \n• Understanding AI Technology: Greg Allen, Chief of Strategy and Communications Joint \nArtificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), Department of Defense \nhttps://www.ai.mil/docs/Understanding%20AI%20Technology.pdf \n            Understanding Artificial Intelligence Technology \n \n Gregory C. Allen | DoD Joint AI Center \n14 \n14 \nSemi-Supervised  Learning: There  is  also  an  increasingly  popular  class  of  “Semi-\nSupervised”    algorithms    that    combine    techniques    from Supervised    and \nUnsupervised algorithms for applications with a small set of labeled data and a \nlarge  set  of  unlabeled  data.  In  practice,  using  them  leads  to  exactly  what  you \nwould  expect,  a  mix  of some  of both  of  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of \nSupervised and Unsupervised approaches. \n \nReinforcement Learning:  In Reinforcement Learning, the training data is collected \nby  an autonomous,  self-directed AI  agent  in  the  course  of perceiving  its \nenvironment (which  might  be  the  real  world  or  a  simulated  environment)  and \nperforming goal-directed actions (trying to maximize receipt of “rewards”). Four \naspects  of Reinforcement  Learning are  notably  distinct  from Supervised  and \nUnsupervised Learning: \n \n1) Data is gathered by the AI agent itself in the course of its interacting with \nthe environment and perceiving stated changes. For example, an AI agent \nplaying  a  digital  game  of chess  makes  moves  and  perceives  changes  in \nthe board based on its moves. \n2) The rewards are input data received by the agent when certain criteria are \nsatisfied. For  example,  a Reinforcement  Learning AI  agent  in  chess  will \nmake  many  moves  before  each  win  or  loss. These  criteria  are  typically \nunknown to the agent at the outset of training. \n3) Rewards often contain only partial information. A reward like a win in chess \nconveys  that  some  inputs  must  have  been  good,  but  it  doesn’t  clearly \nsignal which inputs were good and which were not.  \n4) The  system  is  learning an  action  policy for taking  actions  to maximize  its \nreceipt of cumulative rewards.   \n \nFigure 5: Simplified Reinforcement Learning Diagram \n \n\n \n• AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning Explained Simply: Jun Wu \nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/ai-machine-learning-deep-learning-explained-simply-\n7b553da5b960 \n• The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: Databricks \nhttps://databricks.com/discover/pages/the-democratization-of-artificial-intelligence-and-\ndeep-learning \n• Final Report: National Security Report on Artificial Intelligence https://www.nscai.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/03/Full-Report-Digital-1.pdf \n• A Beginners Guide to Neural Nets and Deep Learning: Pathmind \nhttps://wiki.pathmind.com/neural-network \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

        "Why is Machine Learning Possible Now?": "Machine learning is possible now because it allows computers to \"learn by example\" through training with large volumes of data, which was not possible with traditional programming on classic computers that operated based on fixed rules. This training process enables computers to make predictions and complex decisions autonomously once the model is trained.",
        "Imagine it’s 1950, and you’re a visitor who traveled back in time from today. Your job is to explain the impact computers will have on business, defense, and society to people who are using manual calculators and slide rules?": "The impact of computers on business, defense, and society would be explained by highlighting how they can enable digital transformation, streamline operations, enhance decision-making processes, and provide a competitive edge. Businesses and governments adopting computers and learning to code would have a significant advantage over their competitors/adversaries in terms of efficiency, innovation, and strategic capabilities. This analogy illustrates the transformative potential of technology adoption and adaptation in driving progress and success.",

He knows about wanting to do something unforgivable. The\nonly difference between him and the monsters they killed was that he’d never give in.\n\nChapter 1\nChapter Notes\nSee the end of the chapter for notes\nDean sometimes wonders about the creatures that they hunt. Not the really grotesque ones,\nbut the more human ones, the ones who try to fit into society. Did they ever try to resist their\nbaser urges? Did they ever feel guilty for the harm they caused? Or was the urge to kill,\nmaim, or consume so strong, the need so deep and fundamental to their being that there was\nno hope for them to not give in? Even if it hurts someone?\nDean knows what that feels like. He knows about wanting to do something unforgivable. The\nonly difference between him and the monsters they killed was that he’d never give in.\n***\nThis is how it starts: Dean, age fifteen, fingering a girl for the first time on a slide in a\ndeserted playground, late at night, swings creaking lazily as they float back and forth in the\ncool breeze. Marveling at the slick warmth welcoming his fingers eagerly as the girl squirms\nagainst him, thinking, I can’t wait to tell Sam about this. \nSam hits a growth spurt, baby fat melting away, and starts outgrowing his clothes at a pace\nthat their father’s hustling for cash can’t match. He’s stuck wearing old pants that end just\nabove his ankles and too-short shirts that leave a strip of lower belly exposed. The hair there\nis just beginning to darken and thicken and Dean is fascinated, eyes running over that pale\nskin over and over, wondering when his little brother started growing up. It makes him feel\nweird in a way he doesn’t understand.\nAge sixteen, finding Sam’s sticky underwear for the first time, stuffed deep as they can go\ninto the laundry bag.  Feeling his stomach clench, disgusted and excited all at once,\nwondering when his little brother found the private time to make this mess. It must have\nhappened while he was asleep, only a few feet away from Dean.\nThe summer after Sam turned thirteen, Dad parks them at a cabin in rural Missouri while he’s\nhunting some local monster. They hitch a ride with a neighbor in the back of his pickup truck\nand head to the river to swim. Sam is still growing like crazy, but he hasn’t quite grown into\nthe hand-me-down swim trunks he’s wearing that summer, some faded blue article Dean\nbarely remembers. They hang low on his skinny hips, showing off that every-darkening trail\nof hair, and Dean’s head is buzzing but he doesn’t understand why. Sam dives right into the\ncool, clear water, fearless, but Dean hovers on the gravel bank. Dean watches his brother\nemerge from the water, his trunks slip somehow even lower from the weight of the water, and\nDean’s mouth goes dry. Sam’s been especially active that summer, running in the mornings\nbefore the humidity really sets in, and John hasn’t been especially generous with the grocery\nbudget, so he’s leaner than normal. Dean would love to blame his interest on concern for\nSam’s weight and well-being but that is belied by the heat in his gut.\n\nDisparate events that began to add up to a specific, life-ruining conclusion, his mind\nskittering away from the meaning like a cockroach fleeing under the bathtub when you flip\non the bathroom light. Something grotesque. Something he couldn’t, wouldn’t, name.\nBut he can’t deny it forever. \nNot too long after Missouri, after they’ve moved on to the next shitty town, John has them\nout in a field on the outskirts of town training, first agility drills, then pushups and situps,\nnow sparring, and they’re both already exhausted. Sam pins Dean for the second time in a\nrow and John is not pleased.\n“Go again. Dean, where's your head at today?\" \nDean's not sure either but he's got a theory. It's still hot in the late summer evening, and the\nair is completely still in the clearing. Sam is shirtless, sweat shining in the setting sun, too\nslippery for Dean to get a hold on, limbs sliding out from under his grasp when he tries to\ngrab him. They go again, and Dean is determined to take his brother down this time. Sam is a\ngreat fighter, especially for his size, but he can tell Sam is tired. He has a tell when he’s about\nto go for Dean’s legs, so when Dean sees it he steps to the side and tackles Sam to the\nground. They fall into a tangle of limbs, Sam struggling against him, and somehow Dean’s\nface ends up shoved into the crevice of Sam’s armpit. The smell hits him all at once: it’s a\nfamiliar smell, a Sam smell, almost sweet, with a newfound sharpness from his burgeoning\npuberty. Sam isn’t old enough yet to need deodorant so the scent is unmasked, and Dean gets\na nose full of it, a shock of arousal flooding his system. He’s so distracted that Sam nearly\ngets a leg up on him, but Dean recovers enough to brace his forearm against Sam’s chest,\nusing more weight than necessary to pin him. \nTheir father hoots from the sidelines, pleased. \n“All right, Dean, that’s more like it! That’s enough for today, let’s head back.” Dean\nscrambles off his brother and stands up, Sam following his lead. Dean lags behind Sam in\norder to surreptitiously palm his cock, finding it half hard, and adjusting it so it’s less\nobvious.\n“Hey man, I think it might be time you start wearing deodorant. You kinda stink,” he says\nonce Sam catches up to him as they walk back to the car.\n“Shut up! No, I don’t!” Sam’s face is mottled red, and Dean can’t tell if the flush is from\nembarrassment or exertion or some mix of the two.\nTheir father must overhear their conversation. \n“Aw, Sammy, nothing to be embarrassed about, you’re becoming a man,” their father pipes in\nas he loads their gear into the trunk. “I’ll grab you some Teen Spirit next time I go on a\nsupply run. You can just borrow Dean’s for now.” \nSam grumbles under his breath about stray armpit hairs but doesn’t argue. \n\nOn the ride back to the motel, Dean’s on edge, drumming his fingers on the car door. He can’t\nstop thinking about what just happened back at the field. Smelling Sam, being close to him\nlike that, it should have grossed him out, right? So why didn’t it? Did he–was he– into Sam?\nHe’d just gotten hard over his brother. There was no arguing with that. His stomach turns.\nHis father and brother continue bickering as Dean’s world falls apart around him.\n***\nDean could chalk it up to a lot of things. Excitement, heat, an involuntary reaction to a warm\nbody rubbing up against him. He wants to excuse it away but deep down he knows the sad,\nrotten truth of the thing. \nHis whole life, he’s taken care of Sam. He’d do anything for him. He loves him more than\nanyone else in his life. Somewhere along the way, without Dean’s permission, that love had\ntwisted into something ugly.\nHe shouldn't be surprised. The realization has been building for a while, but now, having\nundeniable physical proof of his perversion, he still feels like the world is ending. It feels\nsurreal almost, like it’s something so preposterous that his mind simply refuses to accept it;\nme? Attracted to my brother, of all people? The universe would never be so cruel. \nBut it's true. It's been growing inside him for so long, longer than he could acknowledge even\nto himself, and it was only getting bigger. What started as a tiny seed of sickness somewhere\ndeep down grew into a yawning want, eating him up inside.\n***\nSometimes Dean can go days, weeks even, without thinking of it: Sam would just be Sam,\nhis dorky little brother, nose usually stuck in a book if he wasn’t busy annoying the shit out\nof Dean. But then out of nowhere something would happen and it would hit him. Sam would\ndo something cute, find the bit of lore that they need to solve a case, or he'd realize he's been\nstaring at him chewing on his pencil for five minutes, and he'd think, oh, right.  \nDean has rules. Rules about what he can and can’t do with Sam, rules that keep them both\nsafe. Only touch Sam the bare minimum. Don't look at him the wrong way too much. And try\nnot to fucking think about it. \nWhen it gets too bad he won’t let himself touch Sam at all. No more high fives, hair ruffles,\nor noogies. Roughhousing is absolutely out of the question, and the prescribed sparring\npractice was torturous, leaving Dean feeling weird and exhilarated for all the wrong reasons.\nEven a touch he knew was innocent would set him off and he'd end up feeling gross, as if he\ntook advantage of Sam, tainted him somehow. Those days he'd train until he puked and drink\nuntil he blacked out. \n***\nDean tries to stay busy. Since he could pass for fifteen he's been picking up odd jobs in\nwhatever town they were passing through, so long as they paid cash under the table. He was\nalways the first to volunteer to clean the guns or restock their supplies–which had the dual\n\nbenefit of pleasing his father while also keeping him occupied–and, of course, he spent a not\ninconsiderable amount of time chasing after girls. \nSometimes he doesn't have to chase them, really. There’s no shortage of women, of various\nages, making their intentions very clear to him. He's known how to make a girl blush and bat\nhis eyes at him since he was thirteen, and he'd only refined his technique in the subsequent\nyears. He still loves girls–sliding his hands through their long, silky hair as they mouth at his\ncock, slipping panties down smooth legs, the sounds they make as he sinks deep into their\npretty pink pussies. Girls are easy. Girls are safe. \nHis father trains them hard. Sprints, sparring, target practice, and Dean pushes himself to his\nlimits, ending many training sessions on his knees, sweat soaking his shirt and nauseous from\nexertion. After he trains like that, when he's pushed his body as hard as he can, his brain and\nbody are so exhausted that his mind is mercifully quiet. He feels at peace. \nBut sometimes, especially lately, his mind is loud, cranked up all the way with the knob torn\noff. No matter what he does, how hard he trains, who he fucks, he can't stop thinking about it.\nHe can’t stop thinking about Sam.\n***\nDean’s just settling down on the couch with a beer fresh from the refrigerator when he hears\nthe key turning in the door of their latest shithole rental. He looks up from where he’s \nflipping through the TV to see Sam coming in from a run, kicking the door shut behind him\nand toeing off his shoes. It’s late in May during a record heat wave, and his t-shirt is soaked\ndown his chest and back with sweat, and more drops are still sliding down his hair and neck.\nDean tracks a bead of it as it makes its way down his neck and under the collar of his faded t-\nshirt, rubbing absent-mindedly at the condensation on the side of his beer bottle.\nSam gives him a quick greeting and peels off his soiled shirt, throwing it on the floor before\nheading to the fridge and rummaging around. Dean’s eyes follow the line of his brother’s\nback as he searches the middle shelf before turning around, clutching a cold can of soda. His\neyes sweep down the tanned, sweaty chest and toned stomach heading back toward him, but\nhe quickly forces himself to turn back to the TV. He takes a long drink of his beer.\nSam plops himself down right next to Dean on the couch, despite there being a free armchair\nto their right, and pops the top on his drink and takes a big swig. When he moves, Dean\ncatches a strong whiff of the results of his little brother’s exercise, and his stomach twists in a\nstrange combination of disgust and arousal at the scent, sharp and musky. His mouth goes\ndry, and he pushes Sam away and says, “Dude, personal space much? You fucking reek.” \nSam just laughs and says, “Oh, yeah, you think that’s bad,” before launching himself at Dean\nwith his arm raised, trying to shove his armpits into Dean’s face. He suddenly finds his lap\nfull of sweaty teenage boy, and his armpit nearly makes direct contact with Dean’s nose\nbefore he gets a firm grasp on him. This means Sam is seated mostly on top of him, shirtless,\nwith Dean gripping him at the waist: either to keep him at bay or pull him closer, he hasn’t\ndecided yet. \n\nDean freezes, a jolt of arousal shooting through him at the feel of Sam’s heated skin under his\nhand, combined with the sweet, sharp smell of his sweat. Fear seizes him as he realizes he’s\ngetting hard, and with how Sam is sitting on him, he’ll feel it if he pays attention. Dean\npushes Sam away with more force than necessary, panicking, but quickly recovering and\ncovering it up with anger.\n“Jesus, Sam, what’s the matter with you? Don’t be fucking gross,” he snaps, standing up from\nthe couch and snatching his beer from the coffee table. “Just for that, you have to wait to\nshower. Since now I need one too.” \n“Hey, no fair!” Sam calls from behind as he leaves the living room. \nHe heads into the bathroom despite Sam’s protests and shuts the door and locks it before\nleaning his back against the door, finally taking a breath.\nHis heart’s still racing and he's half chubbed in his jeans. He could be imagining it, but he\nthinks he can still smell Sam’s sweat even in here—maybe he really had been able to rub his\nnose in it. The thought sends a shock straight to his dick, and his hand goes down to grip\nhimself through his pants, pushing it up against his body to relieve some pressure.\n“Fuck,” he says quietly to himself before leaning over to turn the shower on and getting in—\ncold water be damned. Facing away from the spray, he keeps his head out of the water at first,\nhoping to cling to the last remnants of Sam’s smell on his face as he takes his dick in hand.\nHe replays the events from the couch, recalling the slick feel of the sweat on his brother's\noverheated skin, the pressure of his body on his lap, and the musky-sharp smell of his sweat.\nHe tries to take in as much of the smell as he can and imagines the scene playing out\ndifferently—maybe he’d turn it around on Sam, grab him when he went to push his armpit\ninto his face, and actually pull Sam into his lap properly and pull his armpit all the way into\nhis face so he could get a real smell. He knows the scent would be strongest there, and he\ncould take in as much of it as he wanted, while Sam writhed in his lap. If he wants, he doesn't\nhave to stop at just smelling—he imagines holding Sam’s arm up and running his tongue\nthrough the sweat gathered in his growing armpit hair. Dean groans at the thought, speeding\nup his strokes. Would it tickle? Would Sammy like it? Would his dick be just as hard as\nDean’s is right now? He pictures rubbing his dick in Sam’s armpit, then rubbing his come in\nto mix with the sweat, and falls over the edge. His come hits the shower wall and he watches\nit drop down the tile.\nAs the pleasure wears off, the shame over what he’s just been fantasizing about creeps in, an\nemotion that’s now sickeningly familiar to Dean. Disgust roils in his gut. He turns the water\nall the way cold and stands in it, shivering. Fuck. He just came thinking about his little\nbrother. And it wasn’t the first time. It wasn't even the fifth time. He shuts off the shower,\ntowels off, avoiding his own reflection. Thinking, I’m a freak. He finally meets his own eyes\nin the chipped mirror above the sink and clenches his jaw, resolute. This has got to stop. I\ncan’t let this happen again. I just won’t think about him like that. His reflection looks\nunconvinced. \n***\n\nThey’ve been staying at a walk-up apartment in southern Illinois for nearly an entire\nsemester, a rarity, when John announces that it’s time to move on. He tells them on a Friday\nnight over pizza, grease stained boxes stacked on the chipped formica countertop, a rapidly\nwarming two-liter bottle of soda sweating on the table in the middle of them. Sam’s still\nchewing his bite when he starts to argue.\n“But Dad, finals are only two weeks away! We can’t leave now, if I miss these finals there’s\nno way I’d be prepared for the tests at another school. Even if I could get enrolled in time,”\nhe makes his case. \n“I’m sorry son, there’s something nasty out west and they need my help.”\nDean sees how upset Sam is, how hard he’s trying to reign it in, jaw clenched and forehead\nvein bulging.\n“Can’t we wait just ten more days? I can see if my teachers will let me take all my finals on\nMonday of the last week of school, that way we can still leave before school lets out. I\nhaven’t even started studying for them yet...”\n“Well, can’t you talk to them and see if they’ll let you take them this week? You’re smart,\nSam, you can study this weekend and be ready.”\n“They’re not going to let me take my finals early for no good reason,” Sam says, dejected.\n“People are dying, Sam. Don’t you think that’s a good enough reason?”\n“Sure, Dad, let me just go to my teachers and say that I need to take all my finals early\nbecause my dad has to move us across the country yet again to kill some stupid monster.”\nSam is raising his voice now.\n“Watch it,” his dad growls. They’re both glaring at each other now. Dean needs to intervene\nbefore things escalate.\n“Sam, I can go with you to school on Monday and explain the situation, and I can help you\nstudy, right? Flashcards and all that crap. We’ll make a game out of it,” he says, hoping to\nmollify his little brother.\nWhen Sam looks at him he can’t help but think he looks disappointed in Dean, but he nods in\nagreement. Their dad seems happy with this plan and that seems to settle the matter. They\nfinish their pizza but Sam is quiet the rest of the meal.\nAfter they eat, Dean tidies up the kitchen. He’s walking back from throwing the pizza boxes\nout when he finds Sam sitting on the cracked swing on the front porch. He’s shuffling his feet\non the sagging wood of the porch, picking at the peeling paint of the swing, looking\npreoccupied. Dean takes a seat next to him but Sam doesn’t acknowledge his brother joining\nhim. \nTheir street is quiet, nobody in sight. They both look out across the patchy lawn at the setting\nsun. The neighbor’s sprinkler is singing a rhythmic whirring song next door and Dean can\n\nsmell someone barbecuing nearby. There’s a brood of cicadas that came over from Iowa that\nyear, one of those big ones that only comes out every seventeen years, and their mating calls\ncreate an undulating buzz that echoes throughout the neighborhood.\nDean interrupts the sounds of the evening with a loud burp.\n“Ugh! Dude, you’re so gross,” Sam says, shoving his brother away, but he’s laughing. \n“Sorry, man, you know what soda does to me,” he says, grinning with his hands up.\nHis smile fades and Sam returns to his brooding.\n“Guess I know what I’ll be doing this weekend,” he says, doom and gloom out of place on\nhis fourteen-year-old face.\n“Hey, it won’t be so bad. You’re a big nerd, you love school and shit,” Dean says. “And I\nmeant what I said about helping you study. Whatever you need, you’ve got me for the whole\nweekend. And on Monday I’ll go in and talk to the principal and explain that we have to\nmove and they’ll let you take your finals early and it’ll all work out, you’ll see.”\n“But like, even that, that you’re the one who has to go in and talk to the school, and not him,\nit's just...” Sam trails off. “I feel like he doesn’t care about me. Like he doesn’t care about\nanything as much as he cares about finding the thing that killed mom, and he just makes you\ntake care of everything else,” he finishes. Dean's chest clenches.\n“Hey, Sam, I know Dad can be hard on you, and I know you hate moving all the time, but he\nloves you. He loves us more than anything. He cares about us but he cares about helping\nother people too. That’s why we have to leave now, so he can stop more people from getting\nhurt. He doesn’t want anyone else to have to go through what he went through with Mom.”\nSam contemplates this.\n“Yeah, but,” Sam swallows, \"I can’t even remember her, but it’s like she’s still here all the\ntime. He still talks about her, or at least talks about whatever killed her, but I barely even\nknow what she looked like. I’ve only seen pictures. I feel like she’s still here, but only you\nand Dad actually remember her, so I’m missing someone I don’t even really know,” Sam\nfinishes. He looks over at Dean, whose heart is aching for his little brother. \nHe grabs Sam then, wrapping his arms around his skinny shoulders, and Sam comes\nwillingly. He tucks his head into Dean’s neck like he always has. Dean swears each time they\ndo this, Sam has to bend over further to make himself fit. He’s growing up so fast. Sam\nsettles in and Dean wraps his other arm around him, breathing in the familiar, comforting\nsmell of his brother. \nHe hates seeing Sam upset and hates not being able to help even more. He wishes he could\ntake away all of Sam’s pain but he can’t, so he does what he’s always done and holds him\neven tighter. “I know it sucks. But I’m here for you, Sammy,” he says quietly. “Maybe the\nnext town will be nicer than this shithole. And it’ll be summer, school will be over, and you’ll\nhave three months to read all those big books you're always collecting.”\n\nDean can feel Sam nod his head against him. “Yeah, I guess,\" he says, then tilts his head up a\nbit and sighs, breath blowing hot against Dean’s ear. “I love you, Dean,” he says, right into\nhis ear, and a shiver goes up Dean’s spine. Oh no. Not now. He’s suddenly hyper aware of\neverywhere they’re touching, the heat of his body, how close Sam’s mouth is to his skin. His\nwhole body tenses up. \nNo matter his internal crisis, he can’t leave Sam hanging. “Love you too,” he chokes out,\nhoping the strangeness of his voice comes across as emotion and not discomfort. He starts to\ndisengage from the hug with a final pat on the back. Sam’s looking at him when he pulls\naway, face full of love and trust for his big brother. If he knew what Dean was really feeling\nat this moment, he wouldn’t be looking at him like that. He’d be running far, far away. He\nshould run far away from someone like Dean, who can’t even hug his little brother without\nturning it into something else.\nHis body’s become his enemy, taking a sweet moment with Sam and twisting it into\nsomething disgusting. He’s so sick of this. He’s so sick of feeling betrayed by his own\nreactions. He doesn’t want this. He doesn’t want to think about these things, he wants to be\nable to spend time with his little brother and not think about touching his soft skin, running\nhis hands through his hair, or kissing his dimples. He wants to be normal.  \nSam gets up from the swing and heads back into the house, but Dean stays outside for a while\nlonger, stewing in his self-loathing.\n***\nIt winds up that out west meant a mid-sized town in western Nevada, not that far from Reno.\nThey drive through the town center and Dean spies more than one new age and crystal shop\ndotted in amongst the standard offering of businesses and office buildings. \nTheir dad drives down a dead end street and stops at a small white house midway from the\nend. The road abuts an orange grove and ends with a small turnaround area. \nThe house looks... decent, for once, and Dean is surprised to see it. It’s definitely tiny, but it’s\nwell-kept, and all the surrounding houses are much the same. He sees people out on the\nstreet, an older couple walking their tiny dog, a little girl riding her Barbie Jeep. John puts the\ncar in park and the boys clamber out, grabbing their duffles and heading toward the house.\nDean watches as Sam takes in their new surroundings, looking around and running his eyes\nup and down the street. \n“Did you see the library when we drove by? It’s probably only a ten minute walk away,” he\nsays as they walk up the front porch steps. Sam’s face lights up.\nThe keys jingle in the front door as John opens it. The house doesn’t look any bigger on the\ninside, but it’s clean and already furnished. \n“Home sweet home, boys. Now, there’s only two beds, so you’ll have to share when I’m here\nor one of you can take the couch.” The front door opens to the living room so they can see\nthe couch in question, which qualifies more as a love-seat: even Sam, the shortest of them,\nwould have a difficult time stretching out on that. Dean won’t let him suffer that.\n\n“We don’t mind sharing. Thanks, Dad,” Dean says. It’s not the first time they’ve had to share\na room and it won’t be the last. Besides, they only have to share when John is home, and that\nhappens less and less these days. He brought them out here for a hunt so it’s likely he’ll be\ngone the majority of the time.\nIt's actually a nice town, unexpectedly. The house John found is close to the center, not on the\noutskirts like their usual squats, so they’re within walking distance of most of the necessities.\nHis dad sends him out with fifty bucks to get supplies. While he’s checking out at the grocery\nstore, Dean spots a Help Wanted sign. After a quick interview with the frazzled, sweaty\nmanager, he tells him he can start on Monday.\nAnd so they settle in. Sam’s on summer break now and he spends his days either inside,\ndevouring stacks of books that he checks out from the library, or at the local pool, wading in\nthe water and avoiding the hoards of children. Sometimes Dean joins him and he tries not to\nstare too much, but his eyes want to track the water droplets that drip down his brother’s\ntorso. Tantalizing. Dean should be checking out the cute group of college girls home for the\nsummer, or even the young mothers corralling their toddlers in the wading pool, but their soft\ncurves are no match for his little brother’s hollow bird chest. That summer Sam always\nsmells vaguely of sunscreen and chlorine.\nSam seems to have recovered from everything that happened in Illinois. He has enough\nthings to keep his mind occupied and he tells Dean he’s even managed to make some friends,\nsome kids he met at the library. He almost seems happy. \nJohn heads off on his hunt–he’s meeting up with another hunter who’s got a lead on their\ncurrent spook. He takes the car with him but Dean doesn’t mind too much. He’s got\neverything he needs within reach.\n***\nDean toes off his boots as soon as he steps on the welcome mat and leaves them on the porch,\nfumbling his keys with the hand that’s not holding the six pack of beer. It’s Friday afternoon\nand his boss let him leave early. Since he’s still technically a trainee he can't work on his\nown, and his trainer, a young Mormon woman named Shanna, had to leave early to pick up\nher kid. So here he is, with a cold sixer and an Evil Dead marathon on deck to get him\nthrough the evening. \nHe grabs a beer, pops off the cap with his silver ring, and puts the rest of the pack in the\nyellowed refrigerator, slamming it shut with his foot while he takes a long drink. Through the\ndoorway he can see Sam’s beat-up sneakers by the door and the remnants of a bowl of cereal\nin the sink, but he hasn’t seen or heard his little brother. “Sam?” He calls out for him, but\ndoesn’t hear a reply.\nHe wanders through the house, making his way toward the bedroom, looking for his little\nbrother. He hears music playing from behind the bedroom door and barges in, expecting to\nfind him bent over a book or homework (even though it’s Friday, nerd). He opens the door to\nfind something else entirely: Sam on the bed, eyes closed, fisting his cock. Dean’s heart skips\na beat and he can feel the blood rush into his face and neck, frozen in place in the doorway,\nbeer halfway to his mouth.\n\nSam hasn’t heard him come in and he keeps fucking into his fist, arching his hips off the bed,\nand fuck, he looks like he’s getting close. Dean wants to stay to enjoy the show, knowing this\nmight be his only chance ever to see his little brother like this. Sam’s got his shorts pulled\ndown to his thighs and his shirt bunched up to just below his nipples and goddamn he looks\ngood, flat stomach flexing as he fucks up into his hand, huffing out little gasps as he tilts his\nhead back into the pillow, hair splayed behind him. \nHis dick is big for his age–Dean notices this with a surge of lust and an odd hint of pride,\nthat’s my boy –flushed pink, almost purple, around the head and dripping precum. Dean’s\nmouth goes dry. He knows he shouldn’t be watching this. He knows he should turn right back\naround and run far away from the sight in front of him. But that’s not what he wants to do. He\nwants to stand here long enough to see him finish, or move closer so he can get a better look.\nHe really wants to see Sam come. What he really wants is to make Sam come, with his hands\nor mouth or just from grinding his cock on him through their jeans, like he’s thought about\nbefore when he imagined how he could finally get his hands on his little brother. \nFuck. That feeling of shame coils inside him again and he knows he can’t do this, he can't\ninvade Sam’s privacy like this. He backs out of the room as quietly as he can, keeping an eye\non Sam as he goes, trying to burn the image into his memory for later. He wants to get away\nfrom that bedroom as quickly as he can so he makes his way to the living room and finally\ngets to work on his beer, now sweating in his grip. He chugs half of it in one go, trying to\nsteady his nerves, leg jumping nervously once he settles on the couch. Sam was going to\nfinish soon and come out here, and Dean had to act normal, status quo, like he hadn’t just\nwalked in on his kid brother getting off and stood there like a fucking creep. What was wrong\nwith him? The mental picture of Sam’s hand on his cock flashes through his mind over and\nover, but he can’t let Sam know that anything is weird. \nSam wanders in some time later and steals a drink from Dean’s beer, face flushed a satisfied\npink. Dean mostly succeeds at not staring at his hands.\n***\nA few days later, Dean arrives home from work in the afternoon and finds the house empty.\nHe calls out for Sam, and to avoid a repeat of last time, tries to walk with extra heavy\nfootfalls to alert his brother of his presence. He’s nowhere to be found. Dean wanders back to\nthe kitchen and spots a sticky note on the fridge that says only Library in Sam’s tall, spiky\nhandwriting.\nHe’s excited at the prospect of a few hours of alone time, since he’d had a stressful shift, and\nbecause he’s been insanely horny this week and the idea of a long, uninterrupted\nmasturbation sounds like exactly what he needs. He crumples up the paper note, tosses it in\nthe garbage can, and grabs a beer from the fridge before heading into their shared bedroom. \nHe puts his beer on the nightstand before he settles onto his bed and starts jerking off, mind\nbouncing between his favorite fantasies, some memorable recent encounters, and various\nporn scenes that he remembers. He tries to stay focused but his mind keeps going back to the\nscene he witnessed earlier in the week. He tries not to think about Sam, he really does. Trying\nnot to think about something just means you think about it more. He stops and tries to think\nabout something else, some woman, any woman, but before he knows it, he’s no longer\n\npicturing bouncing tits and pink slits, but a thinly muscled body arching on the bed, hips\nmoving. Fuck, Dean can still see it perfectly in his mind. He looks over at Sam’s side of the\nbed, remembering, his mind overlaying Sam’s body on the image he’s seeing now. He sees\nthe shirt that Sam wore to bed last night thrown on top of the dirty laundry, and his mind\nflashes back to Sam rubbing his armpit in his face and he gets an awful idea. \nHe feels like someone else is making the decisions as he leans over the edge of the bed and\ngrabs the shirt. He returns to his previous position on his own bed, jerking himself off as he\nbrings the shirt to his face, inhaling deeply. He lights up at the scent, groaning. It’s\nreminiscent of what he smelled that day in the living room but much subtler, tinged with the\nother scents that make Sam smell like Sam. With the smell engulfing him, it’s even easier to\npicture his memory of Sam touching himself, and imagine even more: what Sam sounds like\nwhen he’s touching himself, what he looks like when he comes. What it might taste like. \nHe groans, dick pulsing, balls drawing up tight. He sucks in the smell of the shirt once more\nand strokes a few more times before he starts to come, body strung tight, spunk shooting high\non his chest. \nHe shudders once, twice, wringing out the last of the come, but his comedown is short-lived\nas he hears the front door open and close and steps moving quickly toward the bedroom.\nPanicking, he flies into action. He removes his soiled shirt and has just enough time to grab\nhis towel before Sam opens the door. He says a quick hi to Sam before heading into the\nbathroom. He showers quickly, not waiting for the water to get warm, and dries himself\nroughly. Dean is rummaging through his basket of (unfolded) clean laundry sitting on the\nkitchen table when Sam wanders into the room. Dean is hyper aware of his presence behind\nhim but Sam waits a moment before he speaks. \n“Hey, did you wear my shirt?” \nThe hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand up. Fuck, the shirt, what did he do with it? There\nwas no way he was stupid enough to just leave it on his side of the bed, right? Jesus, he didn't\nget come on it, did he?\n“Shirt?” He angles his head back at Sam as he speaks but does not turn around. \n“Yeah, this shirt,” he holds it up, forcing Dean to actually turn around and look now, “I put it\nin the laundry this morning but I found it on your pillow when I got home. I don’t think it\neven fits you, dude.”\nOf course Dean knows what shirt he’s holding, so casually too, like it’s not evidence of\nDean’s perversion. \n“Oh, yeah, that one, I must have grabbed it by mistake, it looks like one of mine,” Dean lies,\nhoping Sam will drop it. Dean doesn’t even have any shirts of that color. \nSam looks at him, a somewhat perplexed look on his face, before shrugging and returning to\nthe living room. Dean breathes a sigh of relief, telling himself he has to be more careful.\n***\n\nSummer is in full swing already, and it's still sweltering even after the sun sets. Sam seems\nlistless, sprawled out on the couch, flipping through channels mindlessly. Dean had been\nconsidering heading to the bar to hustle some pool but instead he suggests they take a walk to\ngo get ice cream. \nThey chat aimlessly on their journey, Sam catching Dean up on his latest read and Dean\nsharing the latest gossip about his coworkers. Once they arrive, Sam takes his time reviewing\nthe menu plastered on the side of the walk-up ice cream shop. Dean can’t help but watch\nhim. \nWith his extra cash from his part-time job at the grocery store, plus his employee discount,\nhe’s been able to buy enough food that Sam is actually putting on weight for once. The extra\ncalories combined with swimming multiple times a week means his little brother is filling\nout, packing on some lean muscle. The tips of his hair are lightening from all the time he\nspends out in the sun, the golden sheen adding dimension to his messy mop. Dean thinks he’s\nprobably grown half an inch since school ended. He looks so good.  \nDean then recognizes the shirt he’s wearing–it’s the same shirt from before, the same one\nDean had shoved into his face when he came not two feet from Sam’s pillow a few days ago.\nHis stomach heats, embarrassed at the memory, feeling a strange sense of excitement seeing\nhim wearing the shirt now, not knowing what Dean did with it. No idea that his big brother\ncame just from thinking about him.\n“I think I’ll get a banana split,” Sam announces, turning back around to Dean. Dean settles on\nthree scoops in a waffle cone and orders for them both, handing over the cash to the acne-\nridden teen working the register. \nThe girl at the window calls out their names and they pick up their ice cream. Sam\nimmediately sets to work on his: cherry first, like always, ever since he was a toddler. Dean\nfeels an affectionate warmth swell in his chest. Spending time with Sam like this was a sweet\ntorment, a joyful torture. He was his little brother and he wanted to be around him, to laugh\nand tease and be brothers, but he was so much more than that to Dean. He was his best friend,\nhis only friend, really, the main constant in his life even more than their father. He’d always\ntaken care of Sam and he’d helped shape the man Sam was becoming. He was so proud of\nhim.\nHe loved him. He was probably in love with him, if Dean could even recognize what that was\nsupposed to feel like. The more Sam matured, the harder it was for Dean to ignore his\nattraction. What a sick fucking joke the universe was playing on him. Dean loved him too\nmuch and somewhere along the way it got twisted, but he didn't know how to love Sam any\nother way. His love was heavy. He felt it like a lead weight in his gut, weighing him down,\nmaking him want things that no one should want from their brother. \nHis thoughts are interrupted by a voice calling out from behind them.\n“Sam?” \nThey turn around to see a young blonde girl, probably around Sam’s age, flanked on one side\nby a skinny boy with a painfully red sunburn. She’s got dishwater blonde hair, cropped into a\n\nbob, which she has tucked behind her unpierced ears. She’s wearing an oversized tee and\ncutoff jean shorts that end just above her scraped knees. Her companion is taller, lean, a\nbrunette–actually, he looks a lot like Sammy. \n“Oh, Sam, that is you! I thought it was. We didn’t see you at the library today, we wondered\nwhat you were up to,” she says, all bubbly excitement. \n“Jennifer, hey! I was helping Dean with some stuff around the house today, so I didn’t go,” he\nsays. \nDean hovers behind his brother, somewhat awkwardly. Sam must suddenly remember that\nDean is there.\n“Oh, yeah! This is my brother, Dean. Dean, this is Jennifer and Dylan. They’re my friends\nfrom the library.” \nThese kids don’t seem like the “shake your hand” types so Dean just tosses a salute in their\ndirection. \n“Oooh, so this is the famous Dean. Sam never shuts up about you, you know,” she says, but\nshe barely spares Dean a glance. Jennifer is openly staring at Sam; Dean can practically see\nthe hearts in her eyes from over here. He feels his own eyes narrow. \nSam rolls his eyes as he says, “I don’t talk about him that much,” but his cheeks are pink.\nDean has to fight a grin at that even if he's suspicious of the source. “Of course he talks about\nme, I'm the coolest big brother that ever lived,\" he says, ruffling Sam's hair from behind. \nSam shoves him off and returns to his conversation with Jennifer, who's going on excitedly\nabout some upcoming event at the library.\nDean realizes he’s been completely ignoring his own ice cream and that it is now melting in\nhis hand. Dylan notices the sticky dairy sliding down Dean’s arm and offers him some\nnapkins from his own stack.\n\"Here! I got too many anyway,” he says. When Dean is finished wiping himself clean, he\nlooks up to find Dylan staring at him, eyes running over his chest and arms in his tight black\ntee. He quickly looks away when Dean catches him, embarrassed. Dean doesn't mind too\nmuch. The kid (he's actually not sure how old he is) is pretty cute underneath the shocking\npink of his sunburn.\nHe thanks him and Dylan finally meets Dean’s eyes, cheeks dimpling as he smiles shyly.\nSam seems more upbeat on their walk back to the house, his bad mood from earlier\ndissipating. He’s prattling on animatedly about some plans that he made with Jennifer while\nDean was distracted with his ice cream mess. \nDean clears his throat before speaking. “That kid she was with, that her boyfriend?”\n\nSam looks bemused, shakes his head no, explains, “No, that’s her cousin,” then he shrugs\nbefore going on, “And besides, I’m pretty sure he’s gay.”\nDean could have guessed that, but he still doesn’t like it. \n“Yeah, well, that’s probably good then, because I’m pretty sure she likes you, dude,” and it\ncomes out more annoyed than he intended.\nThis is the first time Dean’s seen a girl be interested in Sam and he never expected to feel this\nway. He should be happy for his little brother, right? Instead, his stomach is in knots. \n“What makes you say that? She’s my friend, we like a lot of the same books–” \n“I mean, I saw the way she was looking at you, she’s definitely got a crush,” he says, turning\nhis head as he walks to gauge Sam’s reaction. \nHe looks confused again, forehead scrunched up. “Really?” God, Sam really was just a kid.\nWas this the first time a girl had liked him? Clearly he didn’t know how to recognize the\nsigns. But Dean certainly could, and Jennifer wasn’t exactly subtle about it: she barely looked\naway from Sam the entire time they were there, fingers twirling in her short blonde hair as\nthey spoke. When they parted, she made sure to run her hand up Sam’s arm as they said\ngoodbye. She was practically batting her eyelashes at him. Dean’s gut clenches with jealousy\njust thinking about it. You can’t have him. He's mine. He knows that’s the last thing he should\nbe thinking, so he tries to overcompensate. \n“Yeah, really. You should, uh, you should go for it, you know? Get yourself a nerdy little\ngirlfriend. She’d be perfect for you.” \nSam isn’t convinced. “I guess. But I don’t know if I like her that way.” \n“There’s only one way to find out, Sammy,” Dean says, hoping his fake confidence will mask\nhis true feelings.\nSam simply shrugs, noncommittal, and they continue their walk home. Sam’s mouth is sticky\nand red from his sundae and Dean decidedly does not wonder if he tastes like cherry.\n***\nThe bedroom is stuffy and hot in the July heat, and the open window isn’t giving even a hint\nof a breeze to relieve it. Dean is lying shirtless on top of the thin full-size mattress, too\nsweaty to bear even a top sheet. The wandering limbs of his growing little brother aren’t\nhelping with his sweating problem. He’s been tossing for hours in the sweltering, still air, and\nhas pretty much given up on sleeping at this point. And here he thought deserts were\nsupposed to be cold at night.  \nHe looks over at Sam, who doesn’t seem to be suffering the same fate, face slack and mouth\njust barely open as he sleeps.\nDean watches Sam in his slumber. His eyes trace over the relaxed features of his little\nbrother, so different from how he is when he’s awake, when he’s always talking to Dean\n\nabout something excitedly. This week he’s obsessed with some history book he just read and\nwon’t stop talking to Dean about it. God, he's such a huge dork. The thing about liking your\nown little brother is just that–he’s still your little brother, your generally annoying,\noccasionally gross, sometimes brilliant little brother, and his own happens to be a huge nerd.\nDean sighs, tearing his eyes away from Sam, rolling over so his back was facing him, and\nDean was facing into the other side of the bedroom. Just when Dean is starting to feel the pull\nof sleep, Sam gasps awake behind him, jostles the bed as he arches up. He can hear him\nbreathing heavily, must have had a nightmare, the sound loud in the quiet room. The bugs\noutside are the only other noise. \n“Dean? Are you awake?” He hears a whisper from behind him. He’s not sure exactly why–\nsome combination of exhaustion and laziness–but he doesn’t respond. Sam gives up after one\nattempt, and settles back down onto the bed. Dean is once again just on the edge of drifting\noff when he hears another noise coming from the other side of the bed, a quiet shuffling of\nthe sheets–he freezes, straining his ears to hear more, to confirm his suspicion. The noise\ncontinues in a familiar rhythm, unmistakable, skin on skin, and Dean realizes he’s been\nholding his breath since he first heard the sound. He takes a slow even breath, trying to feign\nsleep, but his body is suddenly on fire.\nHe’s not sure how long it goes on, it feels like ages and seconds at the same time, while he’s\nstraining to hear every muffled gasp that comes out of Sam’s mouth. He’s hard in his boxers,\ncan feel it throbbing and hot against his leg, but he can’t move to a more comfortable position\nbecause he doesn’t want to alert his brother that he’s awake. Sam’s rhythm quickens and the\nbed shakes as Dean can sense his brother tensing up behind him, letting out a choked off gasp\nas he (presumably) comes all over himself.\nSam rolls over and seems to fall into an immediate sleep, unconcerned with the crisis he’s\njust caused for Dean. Dean’s pulse is still kicked up, dick still hard, and he’s stuck frozen in\nthe bed. He desperately wants to take care of his erection but he’s afraid of waking his\nbrother, so he lies in bed until he softens and eventually falls asleep, the sound of Sam’s quiet\ngasps playing on a loop in his head.\n***\nThe summer marches on much the same. John wraps up his latest hunt in the middle of\nAugust and he's been home since then, drinking on the couch, scouring newspapers, making\nthem run drills, and generally driving Sam nuts. Dean sees his brother’s grip tighten on the\nspine of his book whenever John talks back to the TV, notices how his shoulders tense\nwhenever John tosses yet another empty beer bottle into the trash, and notices how he spends\nlonger and longer periods out of the house since he’s been home. \nThings come to a head Sunday night. Dean arrives home from his closing shift at the grocery\nstore to raised voices in the kitchen.\n“Why can’t we stay here longer? I like it here, I have friends here, I want to be able to go to\nschool with them. Can’t you find another hunt around here?” Sam is close to pleading, clearly\nupset.\n\n“We have to go where people need us, Sam. I can’t help it.”\n“But you can help it, you just don’t want to. You don’t care about what anyone else wants,\nyou don’t care about anything except hunting! I'm not moving again, you can't make me,” he\nsays.\n“Dean, can’t you talk some sense into him? I can’t do this anymore,” John throws his hands\nup in the air.\n“Sure, Dad, just leave everything to Dean like you always do,” Sam says, spitting the words\nat his father. Sam is breathing hard, nostrils flaring, fists clenched at his sides.\nJohn looks thoroughly pissed off now. Dean spies the line of empty bottles next to the kitchen\nsink and knows this could get real bad, real quick. \n“Hey, hey, okay, everybody just calm down,” Dean says, trying to placate them. “Come on,\nSammy, let’s go for a drive,” he says, cocking his head toward the door.\nDean takes the Impala and points it north, heading out of town. They drive past businesses,\nthen houses, until eventually it’s just cactus on either side of the highway and lights dotting\nthe horizon behind them. He keeps driving until he finds a narrow turnoff and follows it for a\nfew more miles before they arrive at a nature preserve. They've come out here a couple times\nto train but it looks different at night. He pulls the car in front of the bulletin board posted\nwith a trail map and upcoming events at the park, Dean shifting the car into park and sitting\nback against the seat. He turns to look at Sam who’s staring out the windshield, unseeing.\nThere’s probably nobody else around for miles, just him and Sam.\n“I know Dad–” Dean starts to talk but doesn’t get far before he’s interrupted.\n“Can we not? I really don’t want to hear you make more excuses for him right now,” Sam\nsays, voice hard. \n“Okay, Sam,” he says, still watching his brother. Sam doesn’t seem like he’s going to say\nanything, so Dean asks something that’s been on his mind, hoping to distract his brother.\n“Have you still been hanging out with that girl, what was her name? Jessica?” Dean is so full\nof shit, as if he wouldn’t remember her name.\n“Jennifer. Yeah, we still see each other at the library sometimes,” Sam says, but he sounds\ndejected for some reason.\n“Okay, and? Did you ever make a move?”\n“We, um, we kissed once, but... I don't know. It was weird.” \nDean's surprised this is the first he's hearing of this. “Weird how?” \n“Just–not what I expected, I guess. Too, like, wet? And her braces kept hitting my mouth, and\nshe was wearing this Dr. Pepper chapstick and that tasted weird, and I don’t know, I was\n\nready for it to be over the whole time we were making out. I guess I thought I would like it\nmore than I did.”\nMaking out. Little Sammy not just having his very first kiss, but making out with a girl for\nthe first time. Dean’s gut churns with jealousy but he ignores it.\n“Maybe you just don’t like her that way, you know? Sometimes people are better as friends,”\nDean says, though he doesn’t think he’s ever met a girl who ended up as only a friend.\n“Besides,” he continues, “there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Jennifer’s just one girl out\nof many that you’re gonna kiss, and one of them will end up blowing your socks off. You’ll\nsee.”\n“Yeah, I guess,” he agrees, then goes on, \"I mean, I like the idea of girls, like, a lot,” he says,\nand Dean can relate. Despite his own obsession with Sam he still loves fucking girls. And he\nremembers being Sam’s age: having no real experience with women, the only naked women\nhe’d ever seen being from a grimy porn mag, how his mind would run wild with impractical,\nimpossible fantasies. ”And I like being around them, and looking at them... And I think\nabout them when I–” he cuts himself off then, shaking his head, gaze locked firmly on the\nfloorboard of the car.\n“When you’re–alone, you mean?” Dean supplies, trying to be delicate. He doesn’t want to\nspook Sam. He thinks of the other night in bed, hearing Sam get off behind him. Or maybe\nnot so alone.\n“Yeah, then. But I don’t know if the stuff I think about is... normal. If I’m normal.” Join the\nclub, kid. It must run in the family. “And it's like, all I can think about most of the time.”\nDean takes a big breath in.\n“Listen, Sam, there’s really no such thing as normal when it comes to sex, I don’t care what\nanybody else has to say about it. Whatever happens between your two ears is your own damn\nbusiness. It’s normal to fantasize, and thinking about something, getting off on the thought of\nsomething, that’s not the same thing as doing it. It doesn’t hurt anyone.” The dissonance\nbetween what he’s telling Sam and how he feels about his own desires is not lost on Dean.\n“Jerking off, thinking about girls, all that stuff, it’s all normal. Everyone does it. And if they\nsay they don't, they're full of shit.”\nBut Sam looks relieved at his words, nodding like it’s exactly what he needs to hear, and\nDean feels proud to be able to help calm his fears.\nThere’s a quiet moment between them then. Dean realizes he’s gradually been moving closer\nto Sam as they’ve been talking so they’re barely two feet apart now. It’s dark out here by the\npark and he can just barely make out the outline of his brother in the dim light, and since\nthere aren’t any cicadas in Nevada and the night is quiet around them. Dean feels like they’re\nin their own little world here, inside the car that they’ve called home for their whole lives.\n“Do you ever feel like that?” Sam asks quietly.\n\n“What, like I’m not normal?” Dean sucks a breath in through his teeth. If Sam only knew.\n“Every damn day of my life.”\nDean can’t quite make out Sam’s expression in the dark, but it’s bright enough to see Sam\ncoming closer, and he can feel it as he scoots across the bench seat toward him. He pulls\nDean in this time, turning his body on the seat and leaning over so he’s practically halfway in\nhis lap. \n \nDean wraps his arms around his brother’s shoulders, and Sam tucks his head into Dean’s\nneck as much as he can with the odd angle. Sam sighs into the embrace. Dean revels in the\nwarmth of his brother’s body against his, trying to appreciate the closeness before it’s over. \nHe wants him so much. The need for Sam is swelling inside him and he feels fit to burst,\nfeels it threatening to crawl up his throat and out of his mouth. He hates it. He hates this\ndiseased fucking thing that’s ruining his life. He’s completely overwhelmed by it. Without\nrealizing what he’s doing, Dean turns his head into Sam’s hair and inhales deeply and\nobviously.\nDean hears Sam take in a sharp breath as his whole body tenses up. Oh fuck. He did not mean\nto do that. Dean pulls away from the hug quickly, clearing his throat as he practically plasters\nhimself to the driver’s side door, as far away from Sam as he can get. \n“We should really get back. Dad’s gonna be worrying about us,” he says, turning the key in\nthe ignition.\n“Dean, what–” Sam starts, but Dean just cranks up the stereo and puts the car into reverse,\nheading back the way they came. They’re both quiet on the drive back to town, Dean with his\neyes on the road, and Sam gazing out the passenger side window. \nJesus, what was the matter with him? Sam probably thought he was such a fucking creep\nnow. It was getting harder and harder all the time to deal with this, to keep his hands to\nhimself. What was Sam thinking right now? What explanation could he come up with for\nwhy his brother was just smelling him? God, he was so fucked. \nWhen they get back, Dean goes inside to check on their dad, who’s already asleep in his\nroom–or passed out, based on the amount of empties stacked next to the loveseat. The\ntelevision is still on, tuned to some late night talk show that Dean doesn’t recognize. Sam\nheads into the bathroom without saying goodnight and Dean decides to walk to the bar. He’s\ngot to do something to scratch this itch or he’s going to go insane. Or do something even\nworse. \nHe gets his dick sucked by a woman in her late thirties in the backseat of her Camry, her kid’s\nsoccer cleats digging into his lower back the whole time. He does not think of anything in\nparticular when he comes.\nHe arrives back at the rental in the early hours of the morning. He can’t bring himself to face\nSam, so he passes out on the too-short sofa, fully clothed. \n\n***\nIf Sam thought that his older brother getting a big whiff of his hair was strange, he doesn’t\nshow it. Dean tries his best to act normal around him, but every time they’re together he feels\nguilty.\nDean combs through Nevada and California newspapers that week and manages to find\nanother potential hunt within driving distance. John sets to work researching, books stacked\nhigh next to the coffee table in the living room. He switches from beer to liquor, the brown\nbottle tucked between the threadbare cushions of the couch. Dean doesn’t mind since it\nmeans he doesn’t have to clean up so many empty bottles. He’s usually already passed out by\nthe time Dean crawls into bed next to Sam.\n***\nThat next Friday he’s out drinking at his new favorite bar–it’s dark, they have a pool table,\nand they don’t look too closely at his fake ID–when this group of teens, definitely younger\nthan the legal drinking age (but hey, so is he), somehow make their way into the bar. They’re\na rag-tag group, scuffed converse and patched up denim, and most of them look to be about\neighteen or nineteen. One of the boys, the smallest of the group, tan, with a mess of brown\nhair, immediately catches Dean’s eye. For a brief second he thinks it’s Sam sneaking into the\nbar. He quickly realizes his mistake, recognizing Sam’s friend from the ice cream shop. He\nmust recognize Dean too, since he sees the boy darting looks at him periodically as he works\nhis way through his third beer. When he passes by the group’s table on the way to the\njukebox, he gives him a knowing smile and watches him flush pink as he returns the smile,\nflashing those dimples. Someone comes up behind him as he’s punching in the keys for his\nselected song, and turns to find Dylan grinning shyly. \n“Hey, I’m Dylan, from the ice cream place? You might not remember me,” he says. This\nclose, the resemblance isn’t quite as uncanny, but there’s still something about him that’s\ndrawing Dean in. He props his elbow up on the jukebox, taking a swig of beer, and says,\n“Hey, yeah, I remember you. I’m Dean,” with his best grin plastered on his face.\n“Yeah, I remember,” Dylan says, biting his lip. \nHalf an hour later, Dylan’s in the backseat of the Impala–John let him borrow it for the\nevening–with Dean’s dick shoved down his throat, naked from the waist down. A buzzing\nstreetlamp is the only light in the parking lot and it’s some ways away. With his nose shoved\ninto Dean’s pubes like that he can only see the top of his shaggy head, and it’s dark enough in\nthe backseat that Dylan could be almost anybody. Could almost pass for–\n“Do you wanna fuck me?” Dylan stops sucking his dick to ask, but keeps jerking him off,\ngrip slick with spit. Dean does indeed want to fuck him, but not just yet.\n“Lay back for me. I want to see you.” Dylan lies back against the car door, strips off his shirt,\ntossing it somewhere in the floorboards. He runs his hands up and down his own torso,\nfingers brushing lightly against his cock and balls, grabs around his thighs. \n\n“Touch yourself,” and Dylan does, starts to jerk himself off properly now, lots of focus on the\nhead, “Yeah, like that, fuck, you look so good,” Dean is touching himself too, rapt. Dylan’s\nface is completely in shadow, so Dean can only see him from the shoulders down, and fuck,\nthe resemblance is unreal. He’s nearly hairless above the waist, save for a few dusky hairs\nleading down from his navel to his pubes, lean, tan, and Dean is practically drooling. \n“Look who’s talking,” he says back to him. He doesn’t want to hear him talk, his voice is too\ndifferent, too deep, some vague accent turning his vowels in an unfamiliar way. Dean gives\nhim a half grin and a shrug, then sits up on his knees, crawling toward him.\n“Turn around.” Dylan doesn’t hesitate to comply, bracing his hands just below the car door\nwindow, already arching his back, eager, letting his knee fall into the floorboard so he can\nspread his legs even further apart. Dean can just barely see the dusky pucker of his asshole. \nHe settles right behind him, wrapping his hands around Dylan’s skinny hips. Dean’s eyes\ntrace the curve of his spine as he spreads his ass open. He’s a fit kid, either hasn’t hit his\ngrowth spurt yet or isn’t going to have one. On his hands and knees like this, with his face\nturned away from him, it’s way too easy for Dean to imagine he’s got someone else bent over\nin the backseat. Sam’s about the same size as Dylan, maybe a little taller, but it’s pretty damn\nclose.\n“Lube?” Dylan nods then rummages around in his jeans, producing a packet of lube that\nDean tears open with his teeth. He fingers him, quickly, impatient now, then slides on the\ncondom and lines up his cock. He pushes in with one steady stroke, and Dylan moans low in\nhis chest. Dean fucks into him a few times, savoring the grip on his cock, before starting up a\nsteady rhythm of thrusting. Dylan is a panting, keening mess, hands scrabbling for purchase\nagainst the doorframe. \nWould Sam make sounds like that? Would he fuck back onto Dean’s cock like Dylan is doing\nnow? Fuck, he’s not going to last long if he keeps thinking like that. Jesus, the kid is fourteen,\nit’s not like he’d actually let Dean fuck him. Not like Dean would ever actually do it. Dean\ngrabs Dylan’s hair, pulling his head back, and fucks him harder.\nBut it’s so easy to imagine it now. Dylan gets a hand under himself and starts jerking, and his\nmoans get loud as he gets close. His mind flashes back to Sam in bed, the sound of skin on\nskin and the quiet gasp he let out when he came. He wants to hear Sam moan. He wants to\nknow what sounds he makes when he’s coming, wants to draw them out of his little brother\nhimself.\nDylan comes (on the vinyl seat, annoying) and the ensuing tightness on his dick means he\nfollows soon behind. In his mind, he hears Sam saying his name when he comes. \n***\nDean thought that fucking Dylan would make it better–that it might somehow satisfy his\ncraving–but it just made it so much worse. It was like adding fuel to the fire, and memories of\nthat night would come unbidden into his mind, except it was never actually Dylan he would\nimagine being split open on his cock. That was new. He’d fucked other guys in the ass\nbefore, but never one that looked so much like Sam. As much as he’d unfortunately thought\n\nabout touching Sam, he’d never mentally crossed that threshold. Sam was so young, seemed\nso innocent to Dean, he never imagined he’d let him spread him open like that.  \nThe mere idea of doing that to his brother fills him with such a strong combination of\nexcitement and disgust he gets dizzy if he thinks about it too long. To be the first one to touch\nSam there, where he’d probably never even thought about touching himself, to show him\nhow good it could be. Dean was a good big brother, he’d be so sweet to him, he could show\nhim how incredible it could feel.\nBut of course he’d never fucking do that, it was just a fantasy. It would be the absolute worst\nthing he could ever do to Sam, to ruin something so sweet. Sam would never forgive him.\nHe'd never forgive himself. He’d have to be scum to stoop so low.\n***\nA few weeks later, Dean comes home tipsy–okay, so maybe he's actually a little bit drunk.\nOne quick beer after he got off work turned into several more, he’s not quite sure how many,\nenough that the bar was clearing out and the bartender was looking pointedly in his direction\nby the time he was finishing his last one. But he’s home now, clumsily taking off his boots\nand leaving them haphazardly next to the doormat, tossing off his jacket onto the chair as he\nwalks by. He debates the merits of brushing his teeth but decides the noise and light are too\nlikely to wake his dad. \nSammy looks to be fast asleep in his bed. He strips down to his boxers and undershirt and\nslips into bed next to him, trying to be gentle but clumsy in his drunkenness, fluffing the\ncheap pillow as he settles in. But Sam’s awake, rolls over to face him as soon as Dean gets\ncomfortable, eyes shining in the light leaking through the shitty blinds from the streetlamp\noutside. \n“You smell like a brewery,” he says, nose wrinkling up. Dean can just barely see him, but he\nlooks tired and sweet. Sammy always looks so young when he’s tired and it makes something\nache inside Dean’s chest. It makes him want to pull him in and hold him to his chest where\nhe’s safe, lay kisses on the top of his head, call him baby and tell him everything’s going to\nbe alright always. Stuff that Sam would never allow these days. That stuff is against Dean’s\nrules anyway. Instead he rumples his hair and says, “That’s probably because I drank one,\nlittle brother,” as Sam tries to duck away from him.\n“Surprised you’re home this early. What, no girls at the bar tonight?” \nDean stops, surprised. Sam didn’t usually say things like that, Dean didn’t think he usually\neven noticed what he got up to when he went off on his own. He thinks about answering,\nthinks about saying no, no girls at the bar tonight, what a ripoff, there must have been some\nladies night at another bar or something, but he doesn’t feel like lying. The truth is there were\nplenty of options at the bar tonight, a couple of them not at all subtly eyeing him up and\ndown as he walked by to use the bar bathroom, but he wasn’t interested. He thought about\ntrying his luck, but he also thought about Sammy alone in the double bed they were stuck\nsharing, and the couple times since then he’s been able to listen in to him jerking off, and the\ncall was too strong. He’s sober enough to acknowledge how fucking sick he his for that train\n\nof thought, for giving up a sure thing for the possibility of hearing his fourteen-year-old little\nbrother rub one out in the dark, but not sober enough to resist the urge.\nSo instead he says, “Why do you ask? Are you jealous?” voice dipping down as he teases\nhim. “You want a girlfriend of your own?”\nSam huffs out a breath. \n“Yeah, right. We both know how that worked out for me,” he says with half a grimace. \n“Yeah, I know things didn't work out with Jennifer,” he says, \"But you know, there’s more to\nit than kissing, Sammy.”\n“I know that, ” and Dean can hear the eye roll in his voice even if it’s too dark for him to see\nit. “But it usually starts with kissing, right? And if I don't even like that, how do I know I'm\ngoing to like anything else I do with a girl?”\nA memory pops into Dean’s head at Sam’s words.\n“You know, sometimes there’s no kissing at all. I’ve been with chicks that didn’t want it or\nwhatever, or that just wanted to go down on me and be done, so it doesn’t always start with\nkissing.”\nDean feels his face heat at his own words. He doesn’t usually talk to Sam about what he does\nwith girls, the topic too close to dangerous territory, but he continues speaking without\nthinking.\n“One time this woman just pushed me down on the bed, took off her skirt, and sat on my face\nand rode me until she came, then she got dressed and asked me to leave. So yeah. No idea if I\nwould’ve liked kissing her, but we still had fun, so you never know...” \nHe trails off, wondering why he’s even saying these things. He wouldn’t be saying this to\nSam if he was sober, shouldn’t be saying them now, but he’s eighteen and drunk and in bed\nwith his little brother and some fucked up part of him wants Sam to be impressed with his\nexperience and to think about Dean with this woman.\nHe hears Sam swallow, throat clicking. Sam shifts on the bed, adjusting his legs and tucking\nthe blanket around himself, and ends up lying closer to Dean. His breaths seem heavier.\n“Did you... like that?” Sam is whispering now.\nHe nods. “Yeah, Sammy, I really liked that.” When did his voice get so rough? “She had the\nsexiest bush and she smelled so good, and she was dripping down my chin the whole time.\nBy the end I was so hard I’d leaked through my jeans, and after she kicked me out I went out\nto the car to jerk off and came in my pants like a fucking kid before I could even get my dick\nout. I could still smell her all over my face and it drove me nuts.” Dean loves that story, calls\nthat one up often when he’s getting off, and he’s so turned on getting to tell it to Sam now.\nWhat he doesn’t tell Sam is that half of the time when he replays that memory, he replaces\nthe woman with Sammy, thinks about him stripping his own little briefs off and climbing on\n\nthe bed and sitting his sweet pink ass right on his big brother’s mouth where it belongs. He\nknows Sam would smell incredible there, taste even better, and he’d lose his goddamn mind\nif he ever got to try the real thing. The thought always makes him come so hard.\nSam is definitely fidgeting more across from him and Dean can guess why, his heart rate\npicking up and gut clenching in nervous excitement, knowing his little brother is getting hard\nin bed with him. This close he can really smell Sam, sweet and earthy, laundry detergent and\nboysmell. \nDean is so turned on and drunk and stupidly in love with him, and he realizes how close they\nare on the bed now, and he wants so badly to reach out and touch, but instead he says,\n“Sammy? Are you okay? Do you need to–” \nHe starts again, voice pitched low, there’s no going back now: “Do you need me to pretend to\nbe asleep again?” Sam gasps, starts to sputter out embarrassed excuses, but Dean just reaches\nout to try to comfort him, hand hovering just over his brother.\n“It’s okay dude, it’s no big deal.” \nDean can see how mortified Sam is as he hides his face into the pillow, and he actually\ntouches him now, gripping his arm and stroking from his shoulder up to the back of his neck\nsoothingly. His hand settles at the back of Sam’s skull, fingers digging in his shaggy hair,\nscratching familiarly as he pulls him close. \n“Shh, it’s fine, Sam, really,” but Sam doesn’t seem fine at all. He sounds like he’s about to\ncry, breaths coming fast and shuddery. Dean then has an idea that would only seem good to a\ndrunk, horny teenager. \n“Hey, here, let me,” Dean gropes around under the covers and finds Sam’s hand where it’s\ngripping the sheets and slowly starts to guide it down the bed, down past his sleep t-shirt,\ndown between his own legs where he’s hard in his underwear. He squeezes Sam’s hand over\nhis cock, and Dean’s hand is so much bigger that he can feel the shape of his dick around the\nedges of the smaller hand. He tries to work up a rhythm with Sam’s hand to get him started\nsince he’s still frozen, telling him it’s okay, it’s no big deal, you just need to get off, until\nfinally Sam’s hand starts moving on its own. Dean reluctantly pulls away then, already\nmissing the warmth of his brother’s stiff cock under his palm. Sam has his face tucked into\nDean’s neck, mouth open on his collarbone as he rubs himself through his shorts. \n“That’s it Sammy, just like that,” he coaxes, so turned on now he feels like he’s suffocating\nunder the blanket. He wants to remember this for the rest of his life, every detail: the sound of\nSam's hand shuffling against the threadbare blanket, the tickle of his hair against his chin, the\nincredible smell of his arousal permeating the bed, driving Dean wild. He can feel his own\nerection pushing out against his thin boxers and wishes he could grind up against something\nfor relief.\nHe tilts his head down to breathe in the homey smell of Sam’s hair when he hears him whine,\n“Dean, I need–it’s not enough–” and Dean understands.\n\n“It’s okay, come here,” he says as he dislodges his hand from Sam’s hair to gently work his\nbriefs down his skinny hips. He feels the resistance as they catch on his erection and wishes\nhe could see, but this is still so much more than he thought he’d ever get, so he’s not going to\npush his luck. \nDean doesn’t need to guide Sam’s hand this time, Dean feels it as Sam immediately starts up\na steady rhythm on his cock. \n“That what you need?” he says and Sam groans, nodding against him. He’s still got his face\nburied into Dean and he can feel everything, his breaths puffing against his chest, his open\nmouth on his collarbone, tongue occasionally darting out to wet his lips, and the regular\nbumping of his arms against him as he gets himself off. His smell is everywhere now, heat\nand sex and Sam permeating his senses, driving him insane. Even in the moment, Dean\nknows he’s going to be thinking of this night for a long, long time. \nSam starts to speed up, and Dean can recognize the signs from the times he’s spied on Sam\nmasturbating enough to know he’s getting close. He pets his back and urges him on. “Dean,\nDean, I’m going to–” \n“I know Sammy, it’s okay, go ahead,” as he presses his lips to the top of his head, and Sam’s\nbody tenses as he starts to come. Dean feels several hot spurts of come hit his shirt and he\nshudders, mouth watering. \nSam's breathing starts to calm as he catches his breath, but Dean is desperate to touch himself\nand he can't do it in front of Sam. He can't let Sam know just how much he enjoyed that. He's\nstill got Sam's come on his shirt so he tells Sam he'll be right back, he's just going to clean up,\nand heads to the bathroom.\nOnce the door is safely shut behind him, he steps forward to brace himself against the\ncracked porcelain of the sink and quickly shoves his boxers down and takes himself out,\nstarting to pump, fingers tight just below his head.\nLooking down he spies the damp spot on his T-shirt from where Sam came on him, and his\npulse ticks up. He lifts the cotton up, bringing the wet stain close to his nose, inhaling deeply.\nHis cock pulses and he lets out a soft groan before he can stop himself. The smell is\neverything: salty, bitter, slightly musky. Not too dissimilar from his own but softer somehow,\nsweeter. It's thinner than his own too, leaving more of a viscous wetness than thick globs, due\nto Sam's age, he guesses. He has to get a taste. He shoves the shirt into his mouth and lathes\nhis tongue against the wet spot, biting down on the cotton to muffle the sounds as he comes\ninto the bathroom sink. \nThe pleasant haze of his orgasm is muddied by a wave of emotion crashing down on him,\nalcohol mixing with shame in his stomach and sickening him. He'd just nearly crossed a line,\na line he'd been trying to stay far away from for years, and it had been so easy.  \nWhen he gets back to bed, Sam is already fast asleep, one leg curled up as he lay on his side\nfacing away from the bathroom. Dean slides back into bed on his side and sleeps as far away\nfrom his brother as possible, protective instincts kicking in much too late. \n\nChapter End Notes\nthank you for reading! i am planning on this being two chapters, and i'm about halfway\nthrough writing the second chapter. things get a bit spicier next chapter!\n\nChapter 2\nChapter Notes\nhello i am not dead. turns out writing anything that's not purely pornographic is hard...\nbut i persist.\nspoilers for the 1997 film The Devil's Advocate and Flowers in the Attic, but if you're\nreading wincest i assume you already know about V.C. Andrews.\nDean spends the next few days trying desperately to act as normal as possible, but every time\nhe’s around Sam he’s overwhelmed with awkwardness, to the point that he ends up staying\nout of the house for most of the week. He picks up extra shifts at work, spends way too much\ntime shooting pool at the bar, and generally makes himself scarce.\nIf Sam notices, he doesn’t say anything, not that Dean is even around to hear it. Dad’s been\nhome all week and he does feel a certain amount of guilt for leaving his brother alone with\nhim, no older brother to shield him from their father.\nHis dad catches up with him Friday morning before he heads off to work, acrid stench of\ncheap coffee permeating the kitchen. John’s been up for a while, or maybe never went to\nsleep, five o’clock shadow darkening his face. Dean goes to pour himself a cup.\n“Hey, you know what’s going on with Sam?” Dean’s hand stills in midair, coffee pot halfway\ntipped over, black liquid threatening to spill out. Dean, unfortunately, might know what’s\ngoing on with Sam. His grip tightens on the cheap plastic of the coffee pot.\n“Dunno, what’s up?”\nJohn shakes his head. “I’m not sure, he’s just been off this week. Real moody. I thought you\nmight know if something happened.”\nIf Sam has been acting strange enough to John to notice, then that means it must be pretty\nbad.\n“He hasn’t said anything to me.”\nJohn simply nods at this, but he looks concerned enough, though the extent of his parenting\nskills stop at ask Dean about it.\n\"I'll uh, I'll talk to him, see what's up with him.\"\n\"Thanks, son. Might do him some good to get out of the house, don't think I've seen him out\nof your room more than twice this week,\" he said, scratching the back of his head. \"Better\n\nhead off to work before you're late.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" he says, though he knows he has plenty of time and his manager is so\ninexperienced and overwhelmed he probably wouldn't notice if Dean showed up half a day\nlate without pants on.\nAt work, things are a blur. He greets people, rings up their groceries and takes their money,\nbut they all might as well be background noise, as distant and tinny as the price check call\nover the intercom. What the hell is he going to say to Sam? Hey, sorry I gave you the bad\ntouch, but you gotta get your shit together so Dad doesn't catch on? Somehow he didn't think\nthat would make anything better.\nHe's ringing up a woman with a screaming toddler in her cart when he overhears his\ncoworker behind him talking excitedly.\n\"—and there's going to be rides, games, Becky even heard they're going to set off fireworks!\"\nDean turns around, but continues sliding the mother's items across the checkout counter.\n\"What are you guys talking about?\"\nHis coworker, Shanna, answers. \"There's a carnival in town this weekend! We're all going to\ngo after work. You should come!\"\nHe answers noncommittally. Shanna isn't exactly his idea of a good time—he's never seen her\nin any skirt shorter than ankle length and she wears a gold cross prominently on her neck\nwhich she clutches whenever Dean makes a comment she deems to be rude. He thinks she\nmight be some kind of a Christian.\nHer information does, however, give him an idea of what to do with Sam.\nDean arrives home from work to find Sam lying in their bed on his side, headphones on,\nmusic faint in the quiet room, reading a thick hardcover book. He stands next to the bed and\nwaves at Sam to get his attention, but he ignores him. Eventually he pulls his headphones off,\nmuch to Sam's protest.\n\"Hey, dickhead, I was listening to that!\"\n\"Yeah, well, listen to this, Dad said you're being a little bitch this week so I'm taking you out\ntonight.\"\n\"I don't feel like going out,\" he said, moodily.\n\"Not even for funnel cakes?\" Dean asks, sing-song.\nDespite his bitchiness Sam perks up at that and Dean knows he's got him now. \"Where are\nthere funnel cakes?\"\n\"Let me shower and change and you'll see.\"\n\nThe carnival is several blocks away but still walkable, and Dad doesn't seem willing to hand\nover the keys, so they set out together on foot.\nThe walk is awkward. This is the first time he's spent any amount of time alone with Sam\nsince that night and it's at the forefront of his mind, and he ends up rambling most of the way\njust to fill the silence. He talks about work and this hot chick who comes in to buy groceries\nevery Thursday, Dad's latest hunt, and he tries to ask Sam questions to get him to open up. He\nasks about his friends and what he's been up to that week, and while Sam doesn't ignore him,\nhe doesn't offer up any information beyond the bare minimum.\nThe carnival is much larger than Dean anticipated, traversing the entire city park from end to\nend. It's loud and crowded. Dean has to dodge a small child that sprints by, quickly followed\nby another chasing him. They walk by booths with games, people sat at tables selling various\ntrinkets, and tent after tent selling fair food. The smell of cooking oil and powdered sugar\npermeates the air. A group of teenage girls careen by on a large twisting ride, their screams\nmaking his ears ring as they pass by. Sam is twisting his head back in forth, eyes wide, taking\nin their surroundings.\n\"Whattya think, Sammy? Rides or food first? I saw they've got that sharpshooter game too,\nyou know we're gonna be awesome at that one.\"\n\"I want to ride that,\" he answers, pointing at the large metal contraption that's come to\nstillness and is releasing its passengers.\nThey strap in next to each other. Sam fiddles with the buckle on his, tightening it.\n\"Nervous?\" Dean asks.\n\"No way.\"\nThe ride starts to move, rotating, picking up speed quickly. The centrifugal force pins him to\nhis seat, and he grips the the ride hard, knuckles turning white. He's laughing before he even\nrealizes it. At the peak of the oscillations, he turns to look at Sam, finding him laughing too,\neyes bright, dimples popping on his cheeks. It's the first time he's seen him smile all week\nand he looks radiant. Dean's breath catches and he can't take his eyes off his brother, who\nnotices and turns to him too, their eyes meeting in shared excitement. Sam smiles even wider\nto find Dean looking at him.\nThey exit the ride on wobbly legs, giddy, still laughing. Dean doesn't know the last time he\nwent on a ride like that and it must be the same for Sam. They stand together outside the\nqueue line. Sam already seems to be in much brighter spirits, grin from the ride still not\ntotally faded from his face.\n\"That was awesome! We definitely have to ride it again before we leave,\" Sam says.\n\"Hell yeah we will. Now let's get you that funnel cake.\"\nDean orders a funnel cake for Sam and a burger for himself, pays, and the woman in the\nstand immediately hands over his order. They find an empty picnic bench a few paces off the\n\npath, sticky from someone's dumped ice cream, and eat their food together. The energy\nbetween them is much more comfortable now. Sam is munching away at his fried treat,\ntalking in between bites, listing all the things they have to do before they leave.\nDean watches him eat, eyes rapt on his lips that are shiny from grease. He didn't realize until\nthis moment how much he'd missed being around his brother that week while we was in his\nself-imposed exile. Sam is a comforting, familiar presence, even if he brings up a\ncomplicated mess of feelings and desires inside Dean. He can’t decide if it makes it worse or\nbetter that he has a fucking crush on his little brother. On the spectrum of sins, is it worse to\nwant to fuck your bother or worse to fall in love with him?\nThey gather their food wrappers and toss them into the trash and head back to the main area\nof the carnival, where Dean declares it's game time. They stop by nearly every game booth,\nrows of brightly colored prizes drawing them in, each taking a turn, collecting a tiny prize\neach time. Night falls around them. Eventually they land at the sharpshooter game and Dean\nknows they've got this one in the bag.\nThey have to wait their turn. A young couple, probably not much older than Sam, are in front\nof them. They watch as a boy in front of them takes his turn, most of his shots landing.\n\"Excellent shootin', Tex! You've got enough points to pick anything from the middle shelf\ndown. The girl points at a small stuffed panda bear and the man, who's wearing a stained blue\nshirt with a name tag that reads Jerry, hands it over. She squeals in delight, hugging her\nboyfriend while still clutching the stuffed toy.\n\"Thanks, babe! You did so good!\" She's clearly elated as she leans in and plants a smacking\nkiss on his lips, before they head off in the direction of the rides.\n\"Dean, look,\" Sam says, tugging on his sleeve to get his attention and pointing to the highest\nrow of the prizes behind Jerry. At the top there's a large stuffed purple dog that looks just like\none Sammy had when he was a toddler, before it got lost in one of their many moves. \"Do\nyou remember?\" Of course he did. For a solid eighteen months, Sam wouldn't go anywhere,\ndo anything, without that damn dog. When they lost it, he was inconsolable for days, begging\nJohn to go back to their last house to search for it. John just told him to suck it up and be a\nbig boy. Dean had tried to help as best as he could, but the only thing that stopped Sam from\ncrying was holding him in his arms, Sam's face tucked into his neck as he snuffled out pitiful\ntears.\nDean nods. \"That the one you want?\" Sam nods back excitedly. \"I'll get it for you.\" The\nimage of the teenage girl kissing her boyfriend when he handed over the panda pops into his\nhead. Yeah, right.\nDean settles in with the toy gun propped on his shoulder, how his dad taught him, and\nfocuses on the goal at hand. The targets pop up, sliding up and down the line, and Dean nails\nevery single one, one after the other. The targets stay down and the game ends.\n\"Whoa,\" Jerry says, clearly impressed. \"Where the hell did you learn to shoot like that, kid?\"\n\"We grew up hunting,\" is the only explanation he provides.\n\nJerry lets them pick any prize from the board and Dean lets his brother pick it out. Sam looks\nso damn happy when he hands over the purple dog and it makes Dean feel like a fucking hero\nto be able to get the prize for Sam. Doesn't matter that Sam could also hit all these targets\nsame as Dean did, no issue. They were trained by the same man, after all.\n\"Thanks, Dean,\" Sam says, heartfelt, looking up at his big brother. Dean feels his whole body\nwarm like a candle catching a light.\nIt's getting late by the time they finish up with the games and they see people heading toward\nthe south end of the fair en masse.\n\"Must be about time for the fireworks to start,\" Dean realizes. \"Want to head that way?\"\nThey follow the crowd, Sam clutching his purple dog to his chest. He looks adorable,\nyounger than his fourteen years, and Dean can't help but think about baby Sammy wailing\nover his lost stuffed dog.\nThey end up in a clearing where hundreds of people, maybe a thousand or more, are gathered,\ncircling around a tent in the middle. Dean points to a spot on the edge of the field, tucked\nunder a tree away from the crowds. He plops down on the grass, leaning back on his hands,\nwhile Sam settles next to him with his legs crossed.\nThe fireworks begin, starting with a spray of white that cascades across the sky. Everyone\naround them breaks out in oohs and ahhs and off in the distance he can hear a baby\nscreeching in excitement. They continue in quick succession, different colors and patterns\nlighting up the night sky, but Dean finds he isn't really that interested. His eyes are drawn to\nSam, where the flashing lights of the fireworks are casting a glow over his face and reflecting\nin his eyes.\nHe looks so much happier than he did earlier, and Dean doesn't want to ruin the moment, but\nhe told his father he'd check on Sam. Should Dean say something, bring up what they did, see\nif that's why Sam has been so moody? Should he make sure Sam’s okay and doesn’t think his\nolder brother is a sexual predator? Dean winces internally at the label, but if the shoe fits.\nSam must be reading his mind, because he clears his throat and says, “Dean, can I ask you\nsomething?”\n\"Sure,\" he says, though his stomach is suddenly in knots.\n“What happened before... last week, what we did. I mean, what I did–” His eyes are stuck far\nbelow the horizon, ignoring the fireworks, shifting back and forth nervously. “Was that...\nweird? Like, bad weird?” He finally risks a glance up. Dean has had all week to prepare\nhimself for this conversation and it never even occurred to him that Sam would feel like the\ngross one, he was so caught up in his own bullshit. He's surprised that Sam is bringing this up\nat all. Dean thought he'd have to start the discussion, but maybe repression isn't every\nWinchester's primary coping mechanism. \n“Nah, Sammy, it’s no big deal to me. Honestly I kinda forgot it even happened.” The\nhysterical note to his voice isn’t going to help convince Sam of anything. \"You needed to get\n\noff and I was just, y’know, helping you out. Sometimes guys do that.” \n\"Really? Guys just... do that to each other?\"\n\"Sure, all the time,\" Dean answers, like he even has a clue. As if he's ever had a guy friend\nlong enough for them to get to the dick touching stage. And even if he has, he doubts they\nwould have done it cuddled up together in bed. He certainly wouldn't have kissed their\nforehead when they came.\nSlowly, Sam nods, but he still looks troubled.\nDean has to ask. \n“Was it weird for you? Is that why you're asking?” He swallows guiltily, afraid of the answer.\n“You can tell me if it made you feel, uh, weird, or—or, you know, bad.” He couldn’t think of\na better word to describe how he imagined it should make Sam feel. How else could his older\nbrother rubbing his dick through his underwear make him feel besides weird and bad?\nSam shakes his head no vehemently, brown bangs bouncing back and forth on his forehead. \n“No, it wasn’t bad at all, it felt really—\" he seems to catch himself, realize what he's saying,\nand starts over. \"I mean, it wasn’t weird for me.”\nClearly neither of them are prepared to talk about this. \n“I just thought, this week, you might be mad because you were gone so much. I don’t want\nyou to think I’m gross, or a freak, or something.” \nSo Sam noticed his absence that week after all. Of course he did, how could he not? Dean\nwas so caught up in his own guilt that he forgot that Sam still needs him to be there for him.\nAnd Dean left him alone with their dad all week to suffer and stew alone.\nThe falling sparks of the fireworks illuminate Sam just enough for Dean to see the cherry-red\ncolor of his face and neck. He wishes he could tell him just how far from gross he thought\nthat night in bed was. \n“I don’t think you’re gross, Sammy. Like we talked about—all that stuff is normal. This\nweek, I—” He doesn’t have an explanation ready and it’s not like he can be honest. ”I just,\nyou know, I met someone at work, this girl, and we’ve been hanging out a lot.” He’s lying\nbefore he can even track what words are coming out of his mouth.\n“You met someone? You—have a girlfriend? You didn’t say anything.” Sam looks taken\naback, head drawing back in confusion.\nDean tries to scramble for details to back up this stupid lie he's just told. \"Yeah, her name's\nShanna, she's another cashier,\" he says.\n\"Oh. I'm surprised you didn't tell me earlier.\"\n\nSam asks Dean about her, normal questions that he would definitely have answers to if he\nwasn't totally full of shit, and the more Dean talks the less he seems like he believes him,\neyebrows drawing together. He stops asking questions and stays quiet and Dean realizes the\nfireworks have finished, the grand finale happening completely beyond their notice. Around\nthem, everyone is gathering up their blankets and chairs and leaving.\nThey make their way back though the fair, silently. Dean asks Sam if he wants to ride the\nscrambler again but he says no, so they leave the grounds and head home.\nDean feels like an asshole. He doesn't know why but he feels like he's ruined the evening. He\nwishes he could go back and undo the lie and recapture the fun, brotherly, close energy they\nhad at the carnival. But why would Sam care if he did have a girlfriend? It's never bothered\nhim before, and Dean's had a string of girls (and secretly, guys) in every town they've visited.\nIs Sam still that upset about him being gone this week, and now he thinks Dean will be gone\nall the time? God, how is he even supposed to sustain this lie? He can't stay out of the house\nevery single night like he has this past week. He doesn't want to be away from Sam that\nmuch, even if being around him is hard. He and Sam don't talk much on the walk back home,\nboth caught up in their own thoughts.\n***\nDean comes home from work a few days later and sees a small nondescript sedan, unfamiliar,\nparked on the street in front of the house. When he gets inside hears voices and laughter\ncoming from the bedroom, so he makes his way down the short hallway. Inside he finds Sam,\nbut he's not alone. Dean didn't expect to ever see Dylan again after they slept together, much\nless find him sat on the bed he shares with his little brother.\nThey're sitting across from each other, knees nearly touching, with a game of cards laid out\nbetween them. Sam notices him standing in the doorway and jumps.\n\"Hey, Dean! I didn't hear you come in. Dylan came over.\" Obviously.\n\"Hey, Dean,\" Dylan says.\n\"Hey,\" he says back, making quick eye contact with Dylan and hoping his message comes\nthrough. Don't say a word to Sam.\n\"Can he stay for dinner?\"\nSure thing, Dean says, and heads into the kitchen to start the meal.\nDean is stewing. It's good for Sam to have friends, Dean tells himself firmly, cheap chef's\nknife running through a yellow onion on a scratched plastic cutting board. He'd just prefer if\nthey weren't friends he'd already stuck his dick in. Ones that didn't bear an odd resemblance\nto the person he's been suppressing attraction to since his balls dropped.\nSeeing them on the bed together just now gave him some truly unfortunate ideas. Dylan was\na really cute guy, obviously, he looked like Sam, and they'd been sitting awfully close on that\n\nbed when he arrived. Was Sam getting curious about guys? Looking back, that was about the\ntime it had started for Dean too, but he remembered being so horny at that age, any naked\nbody got him going. Sam had said a while ago that he was worried that the things he thought\nabout when he got off weren't normal... Maybe this was what he'd meant.\nDean specifically does not allow dinner to be awkward. Sam and Dylan talk to each other\nmostly, but Sam pulls Dean into the conversation enough that he doesn't feel completely left\nout. Dylan, for his part, is actually exclusively focused on his brother, and barely pays Dean\nany mind, eyes trained firmly on Sam.\nFirst Jennifer, now Dylan. Something about that family makes them want his little brother.\nHe can't blame them, but he doesn't like it. Exactly how old is Dylan anyway? Old enough to\ndrive, obviously, and there's no way he doesn't know how old Sam is. How young Sam is.\nHe knows he doesn't have any real reason to feel so suspicious, it's his jealousy coloring his\nimpression of Sam's friend. And maybe it stings that Dylan isn't swooning over him after\nthey fucked in his car.\nThey finish dinner and Dylan and Sam clean the dishes while Dean settles on the couch with\na beer. They chatter as they wash and dry, and at some point the conversation goes quiet, and\nDean can only hear whispers slipping through the open doorway from the kitchen to the\nliving room. Dean takes that opportunity to walk back into the kitchen to grab another beer,\nand he finds them standing next to the counter, heads tilted together, faces close and voices\nlow.\nSam perks up when he sees Dean, pulls away from Dylan and stands upright. He shoves his\nhands back into the sudsy water but his face is pink. Dean doesn't like the look of that. He\ndoesn't say anything, just gives Dylan a pointed look, before retrieving his beer and heading\nback to the living room.\nWhen Dylan goes to leave later, Dean makes his an excuse about needing to grab something\nfrom the Impala and walks him out to his car, stopping under a street lamp. The buzzing light\ncasts strange, stark shadows across his face and body.\n\"You didn't say anything to him, did you?\" Dean doesn't need to specify what about.\n\"Of course not. I'm not an idiot.\"\n\"Good.\" Dean's relieved to hear it, but he's not done with Dylan just yet. His face hardens\nbefore he speaks again.\n\"You know he's only fourteen, right?\"\nDylan's standing under the light and his face is cast in shadow, but Dean can still see him roll\nhis eyes. \"Yeah, and? Do you even know how old I am? I don't remember you being too\nworried about age at the bar that night.\"\nDean grits his teeth. \"You were in a bar. I assumed you were old enough to be there.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you were there too, weren't you? And exactly how old are you?\" Dean was\nnearing the end of his patience with this conversation.\n\"Just watch yourself, okay?\"\n\"You know, he's told me about you guys, about how you move around. How you take care of\nhim. Sam's a smart kid. And he's growing up, whether you like it or not.\"\n\"And what's that supposed to mean?\"\n\"It's funny. It's a little joke between us three, me Sam and Jessica, how much Sam and I look\nalike. What do you think he'd say if he knew you fucked me?\"\nDean went cold. \"You got no idea what you're talking about. He's my little brother.\"\n\"Sure, keep telling yourself that,\" Dylan scoffed.\n\"I think it's about time you left,\" he said in a tone that left no room for arguments.\nDean watched Dylan walk around to the driver's side of his sedan, not taking his eyes off the\ncar until it turn around the corner and went out of sight.\n\"Why were you talking to Dylan?\" Sam asked when he got back inside.\n\"We were planning a surprise party for you, princess. I told Dylan you're too old for a bounce\nhouse but he didn't agree.\"\nSam rolls his eyes. \"You're such an asshole.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, but you still love me.\"\n***\nOctober arrives with a slight chill in the air, especially at night where it dips close to freezing\nin the desert. The leaves start to turn and pumpkins pop up on the neighboring houses on their\nstreet. At work, Dean replaces the beach towels and plastic picnicware with black cauldrons\nand bags of orange candy.\nDean's always secretly been a fan of Halloween, always been more into holidays than the rest\nof his family. They've never been able to do much, never had much extra money for costumes\nor been stationary long enough to trick or treat, but he likes all of it: the cheesy movies, tacky\nghost decorations, not to mention the slutty costumes. Sam's too old now for costumes or\ncandy but Dean still wants to do something with him to get into the spirit of the holiday.\nDean's blown past an old drive-in movie theater a few times while he's out on his own and he\nthinks that might be just the thing. John's been home more lately, which Dean doesn't mind\nbut Sam does. He uses any excuse to get out of the house so he jumps at Dean's offer of\ntaking him to the drive-in.\n\nDean has to work late on Thursday but he tells Sam he'll pick him after his shift and they'll go\nsee what's playing at the drive-in. He feels excited all day, anticipating work ending in a way\nusually reserved for nights when he has a date. If other older brothers feel the same way he\ndoes at the prospect of spending time with their little brothers, he has no idea.\nHe clocks out as soon as the clock ticks over to 6 p.m. and hoofs it home. His father is sat at\nthe kitchen table, stacks of newspapers surrounding him, scribbling in his well-worn leather\njournal. He changes in the bedroom, tossing his work vest aside, and grabs the top shirt on\nthe laundry stack. He hasn't seen Sam yet, but the bathroom door is shut and he can hear\nrunning water from within.\nDean raps on the bathroom door. \"Sammy? You 'bout done in there?\"\n\"Yeah! Just a sec,\" he hears through the wood, before it actually does open a second later,\nreleasing a cloud of steam and some pungent, artificial smell. Sam is stood there, wearing an\nunfamiliar blue sweater, and he's pushed his hair back away from his face and it's got a shiny,\ncrunchy appearance Dean's never seen before. He looks annoyingly cute.\n\"Did you put something in your hair?\"\n\"Oh, yeah, Dylan let me try some of his hair product,\" he says, patting his hair self-\nconsiously. \"Does it look stupid?\"\n\"Nah, no stupider than normal,\" Dean teases, and Sam punches him in the shoulder.\n\"Dickhead.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know. You ready to go? Show starts at sundown.\"\nDean drives them to the drive-in, tapping along on the steering wheel to the music blasting\nfrom the speakers. Sam seems to be in a good mood too, bobbing his head along and not\ncomplaining about Dean's old cassette tapes. The theater has two screens, and the marquee\nout front lists the two films they're showing that evening: I Know What You Did Last Summer\nand The Devil's Advocate.\n\"Oh, hell yeah, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar? We gotta see that,\" Dean\nsays, and Sam agrees excitedly. Dean drives up to the ticket booth and asks for two tickets,\nbut the woman working says it's sold out.\n\"Sorry, boys, all gone. But we've still got tickets left for the other screen,\" she says, and Dean\nlooks over at Sam who shrugs.\nDean navigates the car into the other lot and finds a parking spot toward the back, near the\nmiddle. The sun hasn't fully set yet so the screen is still blank, but the lot is filling up quickly\nwith other cars, mostly other couples or groups of adults, some kids milling about despite the\nR-rating.\n\"You ever heard of this movie?\" Dean asks, fiddling with the knobs on the radio, trying to\nfind the correct station.\n\n\"Nah, but I mean, it's got devil in the title, it's gotta be at least a little spooky, right?\"\nDean hands Sam a twenty to get snacks, and Sam heads off on his own in the direction of the\nconcession stand. Dean watches him walk away, surprised at how much he's grown already\nsince the summer, his head now well above the roof of the car. He returns a few minutes later\nwith popcorn, candy, and two huge fountain sodas. The trailers start to roll as they sit and\ndivvy up the food.\n\"I'm surprised you didn't want to take your girlfriend out tonight instead of me.\" It takes Dean\na moment to understand who and what he's talking about. Right, his girlfriend from the\ngrocery store.\n\"Still gotta have my Sammy time. 'sides, she was busy tonight,\" he says, sliding into the lie\neasily. Sam seems to accept that answer and their attentions return to the screen, each\nmunching away on popcorn.\nThe film plays out like a courtroom drama with a mysterious, demonic slant.\nSex scene, woman licking down his chest, pulling his pants open.\nThe main character, Keanu, has an instant attraction to another lawyer at the firm, a chic\nwoman with vibrant red hair. They flirt alone on a rooftop, and later he has a vivid fantasy\nabout her licking down his chest, pulling his pants open seductively, looking up at him with a\nteasing look on her face.\n\"Whoa,\" Sam says from beside him.\n\"Oh, shit, she's hot.\" Who needs Jennifer Love Hewitt after all?\n\"Oh, wow,\" Sam says next to him, eyes wide in wonder, taking in every frame playing on the\nscreen, enraptured. His little brother is growing up. Just a couple years ago he would have\nbeen making gagging noises at the naked woman on the screen. Now... Not so much.\nThere's a scene playing now where Keanu is having sex with his wife but in his mind she\nkeeps changing back and forth into the other woman he's been fantasizing about. Dean's mind\nflashes back to fucking Dylan in the car before, imagining that it was actually Sam. Sweat\nbreaks out on his scalp, itchy and hot.\n\"This movie's kinda weird,\" Sam says, and Dean turns to look at him.\n\"Not into it?\"\n\"No, it's interesting, I guess. I like Keanu. I want to see what happens.\"\nThere's a crackle of static as the dialogue comes through the radio, revealing another big twist\nin the film, and Dean almost doesn't catch the words. The woman the main character's been\nlusting after this whole time is also the daughter of Satan.\n\"Wait a second, did he just say—sister?\"\n\n\"Half-sister,\" Dean chokes out. \"Sam dad, different moms.\"\n\"So this whole time—he's been her brother? He's been wanting to get with his sister?\" Sam\nsounds appropriately shocked and disgusted. Dean's mouth is dry.\n\"Yeah, I guess so. Pretty fucked up, right?\" It's definitely fucked up. Seeing his own desires\n—lessened even, since they're only half siblings—on screen, played for shock value, is giving\nDean a tangled mess of emotions, disgust and shame and arousal all knotted up together in\nhis guts. Maybe they should have come back on a different night when they could see I Know\nWhat You Did Last Summer.\nThe film goes on. Keanu Reeves kisses his sister passionately, then ultimately commits\nsuicide rather than father the antichrist with her. Well, at least Dean doesn't have to worry\nabout that.\nThey're quiet through the last few minutes of the movie and Dean gets in line with the other\ncars leaving the drive in as the credits roll. Dean changes the radio station away as static\nstarts to roll in, tuning it to a familiar classic rock station.\n\"Do—do people actually do that?\" Sam asked.\n\"Do what?\"\n\"Brothers and sisters. Like in the movie.\"\n\"I dunno, I guess so. I think I've heard about it but it's not exactly uh, accepted.\"\nOut of the corner of his eye, Dean can see Sam nod.\n\"I read this book one time about this brother and sister stuck in an attic by their mom and\ngrandma, they had to take care of their little brother and sister, and they grew up together, and\neventually they... y'know. Got together.\"\n\"That's a pretty weird book, man,\" Dean says.\n\"Yeah. Yeah, it was weird, and really sad, but it seemed like they loved each other. But they\nwere stuck in an attic, and they really only had each other, so I guess it makes sense.\"\nGuess it makes sense. Then what was Dean's excuse? He had plenty of other people around,\nand maybe none of them meant half a shit to him compared to Sam and his Dad, but still. He\nwasn't isolated and trapped with no better options. So then why did Dean want his baby\nbrother so bad? It wasn't the first time he'd asked himself that and it wouldn't be the last.\nWas Sam thinking the same thing? Was he thinking about what had already happened\nbetween them? The lines they'd already crossed?\nDean pulls the car in the tiny cracked cement driveway next to the house and puts it into\npark, turning the key off. Sam doesn't make a move to leave the car yet so Dean stays with\nhim.\n\nSam reaches out and wraps his hand around his forearm. \"Hey, thanks for inviting me out,\nthis was really fun.\" He's smiling softly, looking up at Dean almost expectantly, and he's so\nclose now he can smell the product in his hair again. His eyes automatically flick down to\nSam's lips and his heart speeds up: this is the part of the movie where they kiss. Except in the\nmovies it's a guy and a girl, one of them isn't jailbait, and they aren't fucking related.\n\"'course, Sammy,\" Dean says. He wants to lean down and kiss him so bad he thinks he might\ndie. He knows how he'd taste, like popcorn and sugar and everything Dean's been dreaming\nof for years. Sam's lips part and Dean thinks he must imagine that Sam is drifting closer to\nhim across the bench seat. Dean retracts his arm from his grip and sits back against the\ndriver's side door, reaching for the handle blindly. He's got to get out of this car and away\nfrom Sam before he does something very, very stupid.\n\"Maybe don't tell Dad about the movie, huh?\"\n***\nIt’s the day before Halloween, and over breakfast Sam announces that he wants to carve jack-\no-lanterns, so Dean snags two hefty pumpkins from work and brings them home that evening.\nJohn is gone for a few days, just a short hunt in California, or so he said before he left, so it's\njust the two of them home. Sam walked to the video store after school and rented The\nSlumber Party Massacre, and he busies himself with getting the movie started. In the kitchen,\nDean finds an old ice cream bucket, a couple of spoons, and an old sharpie tucked into a junk\ndrawer, heads back into the living room but Sam isn't there. Dean grabs a beer from the fridge\nand sets it on the coffee table which he pushes against the couch so they have a space to\nwork.\nDean's spreading out newspaper on the floor when Sam returns. He's changed his clothes.\nHe’s wearing a shirt he outgrew two seasons ago, Dean’s not even sure where he found the\ndamn thing, worn so thin from years of washing that it’s nearly translucent. It’s a pale blue\ncolor, commemorating some soccer club that neither of them were ever actually members of,\nthough the logo is no longer legible. He’s wearing gray sweatpants low on his hips, showing\nthat creamy strip of skin below his belly button that occupies an entire lobe in Dean’s brain. \nDean realizes he's staring and returns to his task, flattening out the newspaper and placing the\npumpkins in the middle. Sam settles in across from him and they get to work dismantling\ntheir pumpkins and scooping out the inside, each using their own hunting knife. Sam steals\nsips from his beer whenever he thinks Dean isn't paying attention, and he rolls his eyes.\n\"Dad's not here. Why don't you just get your own?\"\n\"Really? You'll let me?\"\n\"Yeah, just don't tell him. And only one.\"\nSam scurries off and returns clutching his very own bottle of beer. He tries to pry off the cap\nwith his bare hands, but Dean takes it from him and pops the top with his ring. \"Don't chug it,\nyou'll get drunk,\" he says when he hands it back over.\n\nSam immediately takes a big swig. Dean watches the bottle resting on Sam's lips and the\nmotion of his neck as he swallows. Sam chokes on the beer, coughing, and Dean hits him on\nhis back until he recovers.\n\"Man, what did I just say?\" Sam's grin is sheepish and his cheeks are red from coughing, eyes\nwatering.\nSam opts for a traditional jack-o-lantern face and carves it with delicate precision, tongue\npoking out between his lips as he concentrates. Dean carves a pair of tits on his pumpkin,\nmuch to Sam's disgust.\n\"You just don't appreciate my art, little brother.\"\nThey finish carving their pumpkins and they realize they don't have anything to light them.\n\"I think I saw some candles above the fridge,\" Sam says. They walk into the kitchen together.\nSam stands on his tip toes to reach the cabinet above the fridge, and the action makes his\nalready too small shirt ride up even further and Dean can't help but stare. Every time Dean\nsees Sam's body he's surprised at how quickly it's changing. Sam is rummaging around still\nand Dean soaks in the view.\n\"I can't find them,\" Sam says, turning his head around to tell Dean. Dean doesn't pull his eyes\naway quickly enough and he knows he's been caught looking. He makes eye contact with\nSam, both of their eyes wide.\n\"Um,\" he starts, \"Would Dad have some extra in his gear?\" He looks like he's fighting a\nsmile.\n\"I'll check,\" Dean says. He takes the moment away from Sam to gather himself. He's not sure\nwhy Sam chose that outfit for tonight. There's no way he's not freezing. He digs around in\nDad's extra hunting bag and finds two nubs of wax they've used for rituals.\nHe returns to find Sam changing the VHS to the second movie he rented, the original\nHalloween from 1978.\nDean places the candles in the carved pumpkins and lights them with a zippo. The candlelight\nflickers, casting shadows inside and outlining the shapes they'd carved.\n\"Maybe we'll only put yours on the porch,\" Dean says.\nDean turns off all the lights in the house so that only Dean's pumpkin is lighting the living\nroom, then they settle onto the tiny couch together to watch the rest of the movie.\nSam finishes his beer and he's acting a little tipsy, movements loose and laughing easily. His\neyes are slightly glazed over but he's smiling despite the low-fidelity screams echoing from\nthe television screen.\nThere's not much space on the couch so they're forced to sit close, Sam's knee brushing\nagainst his leg where he has it tucked under himself. Dean has his arm spread across the back\n\nof the sofa behind him. A tense scene in the film builds to a jump scare and Sam jumps in\nfright, ending up even closer to Dean. They're almost cuddling.\n\"Sorry.\"\n\"It's fine,\" Dean says, and he can't help but smile. Sam knows how to take down an assailant\nbetter than almost any other fourten-year-old in the world but a fictional baddie from a grainy\nmovie still gets his goat.\n\"Can we sleep together tonight?\" Dean hates how much he lights up at the idea.\n\"Why? You scared of monsters?\" Sam just shrugs.\n\"No, shut up. I just... I sleep better when you're there.\" Dean agrees but he knows he's\ninterested for the wrong reasons. They brush their teeth together and Dean climbs into bed\nafter Sam, nerves eating away at his stomach, but he's not sure why. They've slept together\ncountless times but tonight he feels different, like there's some tension between them.\nDean is dozing, mind wandering lazily, recounting the events of his day while occasional\nflashes of over-the-top gore from the horror movie play through his mind. He can still hear\nquiet shuffles to his right, Sam shifting around on the other side of the bed. He can feel\nhimself tipping over the edge of sleep when a sound stirs him, then he hears a gasp from next\nto him. \nDean opens his eyes, already knowing what Sam is doing, but he’s surprised to actually be\nable to see this time. Sam’s not under the covers, but instead has kicked them down to his\nankles and is touching himself openly in the pale light, boxers shoved down to his knees.\nHe’s already panting, hair splayed out on the pillow. Dean feels like his eyes are going to bug\nout of skull, he’s looking so hard, trying to take in every single detail. Sam seems to be really\ninto it, fucking his hips up into his fist, thinly muscled arms straining as they grip his cock.\nSam doesn’t even seem like he’s trying to be quiet, letting out soft whimpers and quiet\nmoans. Dean feels like he's going insane, like this is some dream he's having and he's going\nto wake up any second. What is Sam doing?\nWhen it seems like he’s getting close—Dean knows the signs already—Sam adjusts his body,\nhalf-turning on his side so he’s angled toward Dean's side of the bed, fist in his mouth as he\nkeeps jerking himself. He can see even better now, the dappled moonlight falling directly on\nhis bed. Dean bites the inside of his mouth to stop himself from reacting. Dean swears he can\nsee Sam dripping, precum shining, as he works his fist around the head of his cock. God, his\ndick is so sweet, Dean could stare at this for hours. It’s over too soon, Sam slowing his\nstrokes, shaking, as he shoots into his first, some of it getting onto the bed, with a muffled\ngroan. He wrings out a few more dribbles, body shuddering, then Dean watches him wipe his\nhand on the sheets, leaving his mess on the already stained bed.\nHe doesn’t look over at Dean, just pulls up his boxers, and rolls over, away from him and\ntoward the wall. Dean is burning up next to him, so turned on from what he’s just seen. And\nwhat the fuck was that? Why had Sam pulled down the blankets like that, why hadn’t he tried\nto be quiet? He must have been too hot under the blanket–except that didn’t make sense,\nbecause it's October in the desert and the heat in their rental house can barely keep the house\n\nwarm, not to mention the thin clothes Sam chose for the evening. And he knows Dean is a\nlight sleeper. And the way he’d turned over, toward Dean, just as he was about to finish... He\nsearches for a reasonable explanation. It was almost like Sam wanted him to watch. As if he\nwas putting on a show, just for Dean.\n*** \nHe catches Sam staring at him sometimes, scrutinizing, like he’s a particularly interesting\nspecimen in an experiment he’s conducting. He always looks away quickly when Dean\ncatches him.\nDean knows something is going on with his little brother, he just can't figure it out. Dylan\nkeeps coming around, but he never catches them as close as they were that night in the\nkitchen.\nDylan was right about one thing—Sam is growing up and there's nothing Dean can do about\nit. So maybe he's interested in guys too. It's not like Dean can give him shit for that. And if\nhe's exploring that with Dylan... Again, Dean has no leg to stand on there. Is that really so\nbad? Dean didn't like it when Jessica flirted with Sam but something about the thought of\nanother guy kissing or touching his little brother, or even the idea of Sam liking it,\nreciprocating, wanting another person the way Dean wanted him. He couldn't stand the\nthought. It made his blood boil.\nSo Dean tried not to think about it. Follow the rules.\n***\nDean's busy on his knees stocking the shelves with green beans, working a double shift, when\nSam surprises him by coming around the corner. He wasn't expecting to see him in this\nsetting but can't help but break out in a grin at the sight of him. He can't think of a time he\nwasn't happy to see Sam.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"I was bored. And I know you're working late tonight, so I thought I could get stuff to make\ndinner for us.\"\nThat's sweet. Get what you need and I'll pay at the front.\nDean surreptitiously follows Sam around the store as he gathers ingredients. He gets in line\nwith him at the only register that's currently staffed once he's finished shopping.\nSam transfers items from his basket to the conveyor belt, and it starts moving, and the beeps\nstart coming as Shanna rings up each item.\n\"Dean, who's this with you?\"\n\"This is my little brother, Sam,\" he answers, unthinking, stepping around him to pay for the\ngroceries.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Sam, I'm Shanna,\" she pipes up cheerfully.\nSam perks up. \"Shanna? Like your girlfriend, Shanna?\" Sam turns to Dean to ask and he feels\nhis stomach drop. Fuck.\n\"Girlfriend?\" Shanna looks surprised. Of course she does. It's the first she's heard about her\nsupposedly months-long relationship with Dean.\n\"You mean me? With Dean?\" She looks appropriately surprised, almost disgusted. What a\nprude. \"I don't think so.\"\nDean watches as understanding washes over Sam. He sees him clock the details about her:\nthe long hair, the even longer skirt, and the unmistakable glint of the cross she has\npermanently affixed to her collarbone.\nSam looks at Dean then, confusion all over his face, but more than that he looks hurt.\nDean doesn't have an explanation ready. He's had how long to think of a cover story? How\nlong to mention that they broke up? But he never did. And now he's kicking himself.\nHe doesn't get a chance before Sam is leaving the store, turning away quickly and rushing out\nthe door with his bags of groceries. He knows he's going to have to do damage control once\nhe gets home and he's not looking forward to the end of his shift. He's not sure Sam will\nbother making dinner now.\nHe makes the walk home with a sense of dread hanging over him. He tries to think of a\nserviceable lie.\nSam is, in fact, cooking when he gets home, and the smell of garlic and onion hits him as\nsoon as he walks through the door. Sam is standing at the stove, back to the door, stirring a\npot on the stove. He doesn't turn around when Dean walks into the kitchen. He hovers there,\nuncertain, watching as Sam shakes salt into the bubbling pot.\n\"Smells great,\" Dean says, hoping to break some of the tension.\n\"It'll be ready soon if you want to grab plates.\" Sam sounds... mostly normal. Maybe Dean\nwas overthinking things.\nSam flicks the knob to the off position and moves the pot off the heat, grabbing a spoon to\ndish out the food. With plates in hand they head out to the couch, where they normally eat\ndinner.\nThe food is delicious and Dean makes sure Sam knows it, groaning in appreciation every few\nbites and telling him how good it is. Sam smiles in response but it doesn't seem to reach his\neyes.\nDean thinks he might be in the clear until after dinner, when they settle onto the couch\ntogether to watch television.\n\"So. You don't have a girlfriend. You lied to me.\"\n\nDean stops, frozen, with a beer stuck in the air, halfway to his mouth. He takes a drink, then\nsets it down on the warped wood of their cheap coffee table.\n\"Sam, it's not like that—\"\n\"Then what's it like?\"\nDean is scrambling. Normally he's a great liar, but when it comes to this, when it comes to\nSam, he comes up short. \"So we broke up and I never mentioned it, what's the big deal?\"\n\"You're lying. You think I can't tell when you're lying? Why are you lying about this?\"\nDean felt his heart rate tick up: he didn't have a reasonable explanation. His explanation\nwas... What? He wanted a cover story for his intense, unending, stomach-turning attraction\nto his baby brother, and why he couldn't be around him without wanting to get his hands on\nhim? No, he has to stick with this lie.\n\"Didn't know I had to keep you updated on my dating life,\" he said, sarcastic, hoping being\nan asshole will make Sam drop the topic.\n\"You've been acting weird since we moved here. I don't get it.\" He says it like it's a fact he's\nresigned himself to, like it's something he's never going to figure out. Like he's been spending\na lot of time and energy trying.\nLater that same night John gets home from his hunt, injured and unhappy. The hunt didn't go\nwell, the thing got away after it attacked him. John was too beat up to track it down on his\nown, so he had to call on another hunter to finish the job. He always hated asking for help,\nand combined with the nasty scratch the baddie left on his shoulder, means he arrives home\nin a sour mood.\nDean patches him up in the glaring light of the bathroom, uncovered bulb casting sharp\nshadows down his father's face where he sits on the toilet.\n\"How've things been? You had enough money for groceries?\"\n\"Yes, sir, my job pays enough to keep food on the table, plus we've still got the emergency\ncash you left,\" he says.\n\"Good.\"\nDean continues his work in silence, first washing the gash on his shoulder, rinsing away the\ndirt and crusted blood to expose shocking red flesh underneath.\n\"How's your brother? He doing his homework?\"\n\"Yeah, dad, you know I don't need to tell him to stay on top of school. He's always been a wiz\nkid. Way better at that shit—that stuff than I ever was.\" He's pissed at me right now, Dean\nthought, but he wasn't going to get into that with his dad. How could he explain to his father\nwhy he lied about having a girlfriend to his little brother?\n\nHis dad doesn't ask about Dean, about how he's been, he just checks the bandage once the\nwork is complete and nods before leaving the bathroom. Dean's learned not to expect\nanything more.\n***\nDean wakes up to a noise off to his left in bed. It's late. In his sleep-addled haze he doesn't\nrecognize it at first, but his brain can't mistake the quiet keens and hitched breath after\nhearing it firsthand just a few days ago. Sam is touching himself again, and he's not being\nparticularly quiet about it this time.\nTheir bedroom door is cracked and Dean can hear the quiet noise of his father from the living\nroom, awake, the shuffle of newspaper and quiet murmur of the television still playing. Dim\nlight spills into the room through the opening of the door. If John took a moment to listen in\nhe'd definitely be able to hear the noises Sam is making. Dean doesn't want to see how John\nwould react to that and he knows Sam doesn't either even if he's not thinking with his upstairs\nbrain right now. Dean, thinking quickly, reaches over and covers Sam's mouth with his hand.\nThey're both lying on their sides facing toward the wall, with Dean on the outside. Sam\njumps, stilling, then turns his head to try to look behind Dean behind him. In the pale light of\nthe room, Dean nods pointedly in the direction of the open bedroom door and presses his\nhand more firmly against his little brother's mouth. \nSam holds his gaze for a moment before turning back around, his eyes just barely glinting in\nthe dim light. Dean is just about to reclaim his hand when he feels the blanket shuffling, and\nhis eyes widen in surprise as he realizes that Sam is touching himself again. While Dean is\ntouching him, covering his mouth. He knows he's squeezing Sam's mouth too tight now but\nhe feels unable to retract the limb, frozen in uncertainty.\nSam doesn't seem too concerned about the firm grip as he continues a steady rhythm under\nthe sheets, exhaling harshly from his nose against Dean's hand. Dean is stuck there as he feels\nhimself harden in his boxers. Sam stops, his fingers finding Dean's hand on his mouth,\ncurling his fingers around the digits, pulling them away from his mouth. Sam holds his and\ndrags it down, across the cotton of his sleep shirt, down his skinny bird chest and flat\nstomach, down, down until he places Dean's hand on his hard dick sticking out from his\nboxers.\nDean is so shocked he doesn't move right away and Sam takes the opportunity to close his\nhand around Dean's to grasp his dick and start moving it for him, stroking him where he's\nhard, in a twisted imitation of Dean's touch from the last time this happened. Dean's body is\non fire. He’s seen Sam's dick dozens of times, soft and hard, but now he's actually feeling\nhim under his palm, the heat of him, so hard, and it's overwhelming. Dean knows he shouldn't\ngo along with this, this is breaking every single rule he has, but goddamn does it feel so right.\nSam's sweet dick fits so perfectly in his hand and with Dean this close behind him he can\nsmell him, the bed full of their combined scents from sleep. Dean knows this isn’t okay, that\neven if Sam is asking for it he’s too young to know what it means, that his pubescent urges\nare overwhelming the undeveloped, reasonable part of his brain, and that he shouldn't take\nadvantage of that for his own sick pleasure. \n\nIt’s his ultimate fantasy and worst nightmare combined into one tempting teenage boy\noffering himself up in his bed.\nBut Sam is asking for it, and Dean’s never been very good at denying Sam anything. His\nbaby boy is coming to him willingly, already hard and dripping, and asking Dean to make\nhim feel better: how was Dean ever going to be able to say no?  He grasps him gently and\ngives him a couple pumps, experimentally, and Sam shudders.\n\"Gotta be quiet,\" he breathes, right into Sam's ear. He nods and takes his own hand up to\ncover his mouth.\nHe starts jerking him in a regular rhythm then, trying to match the pace he'd seen Sam use\nthat night he watched him touch himself. His dick is hot in his hand, skin soft and smooth,\nand a blurt of precome drips out from the tip when Dean's fingers graze the head.\nSam is practically vibrating, hips moving in time with Dean's movements. He's so sensitive,\nalready losing it just from a simple touch. It's so hot it makes his mouth water. Was Dean the\nfirst one to ever touch Sam this way? A nasty part of Dean loves that idea, wants to be first to\nmake Sam come, for his first sexual memories to revolve around him. Dean wants to make it\ngood for him. He changes up his grip, moving his fist back up to the head and swirling his\nthumb around the tip. Dean jerks him how he likes it himself, a firm grip, knuckle of his\nindex finger just barely teasing the bottom of his head. Sam's breath quickens and he grips\nDean's arm suddenly, hard, and comes silently into his hand, suppressed moans filtering out\nfrom around his own hand where it's muffling his mouth. He keeps jerking him as Sam\nshakes through it. He retrieves his hand, wiping his hand on the edge of the sheets, before\nrolling over away from Sam. As he catches his breath, Dean becomes painfully aware of his\nown arousal, but he feels stuck, unable to do anything about it. It had all happened so fast,\nunder a minute.\n“Dean?\" Barely a whisper from behind him. Dean ignores him and tries to control his own\nbreathing, feeling himself getting closer and closer to hyperventilating. Sam doesn't speak\nagain and the only sound left in the room is their breathing, and Dean listens as his brother's\nbreaths even out into sleep. Dean lies awake for a long time, until his own arousal dissipates\nand he hears his father shuffle off to bed.\n\nPlease drop by the Archive and comment to let the creator know if you enjoyed their work!",

Enjoy!\n\nChapter 1\nChapter Notes\nSee the end of the chapter for notes\nThere’s a man watching him from across the bar. \nDean keeps one hand curled tight and close around the bottle in front of him. Keeps his head\ndown. \nThere are a couple people watching him, actually: the bartender who winked at him when he\nsat down and bent low enough that he got an eyeful of her cleavage as she served him, and\ntwo college-aged chicks giggling enough that he could probably have fun with both of ‘em if\nhe wanted to. \nTheir gazes are different though, just carousing admiration, a heat behind their eyes that’s too\nfar away for Dean to warm himself against. Flattering, but nothing he has to act on if he\ndoesn’t feel like it. \nAnd Dean doesn’t feel like it. Not tonight. Not with the gouge running up the shell of his ribs\nfrom a hunt he let get too messy, that Dad let him know real quick was his own damn\nproblem to deal with before he left him high and dry in the middle of Minnesota. \nNot with that man’s eyes on him—right on him, a weight against Dean’s skin. \nDean drifts his free hand down to the gun tucked beneath his jacket, and then Dean meets his\ngaze. \nThe guy—he doesn’t startle, he doesn’t flinch from being caught out. He also doesn’t wink at\nDean, doesn’t tip his head slow to the bathroom or the front door. \nHe gets sad around the eyes. Longing around the mouth.\nDean goes white-knuckled on the gun. \n“‘Nother round, hun?”\nDean flashes his best smile up the bartender’s way without thinking about it, already sliding\nout of his chair. “That’s all for me, sweetheart, thanks,” he says, tossing down a few wadded-\nup bills onto the sticky bartop and leaving his half finished beer where it is. “You have a nice\nnight.”\nShe says something back, she’s still looking at him, it would be so fucking easy to turn\naround and touch the back of her hand and ask when she gets off— \nThe man stands when Dean does, and with a last long look, he heads out the door. \nDean follows him. \n\nIt’s cold outside, cutting down beneath the layers of his jacket in the way only a midwest\nJanuary can. It fills Dean’s lungs up like glass shards when he breathes in deep, even colder\nagainst the pump of his blood as he ducks around the corner of the bar in three long steps,\nfollowing the tan slope of the man’s shoulders. \nHe’s waiting for Dean right there on the other side, just leaning back in all those shadows,\nsilent as a prayer.\nDean fits his gun up in that notch beneath the man’s chin. \nGuy don’t even blink. \n“Dean,” he murmurs. \nDean’s hand is shaking and he doesn’t know why. He grips the man’s shoulder, right over the\ncrumpled fabric of the ugly trench coat he’s wearing, and presses the gun up harder until the\nman has to lift his head a little. “How the fuck do you know my name?” he hisses. \nThe man doesn’t look scared. He is watching Dean like there is nothing else worth watching,\nlips a little parted, eyes a little soft. And blue. Real blue, like the ocean on a postcard. \nThe ice spreading down Dean’s spine makes him shiver. \n“I suppose you could say I’m your guardian angel,” the man murmurs. His breath fogs pale\nbetween them. All of him is unnaturally warm, like Dean’s touching somebody with the sun\nsewn up beneath their skin. “I have known you, Dean Winchester, for a very long time.”\n“Wrong thing to say if you want me to lower this gun, pal,” Dean says, and his voice is only\nslightly unsteady. He can hear the roar of cars on the highway behind them, barely audible\nbeneath the rush of his own blood. “Angels ain’t real and everybody knows it.”\nHe fucking smiles. It’s slight, but it’s there—this crazy motherfucker has a gun beneath his\nchin and he smiles at the guy who’s holding it. \n“I assure you, Dean,” he says. “We very much are.”\nThe man is still drinking him in. Drinking him in. It’s hard to see in the low light, but Dean\nthinks those eyes are damp, and it makes something in him go wild, volatile, like a can shook\nup too hard. \n“Listen,” Dean says, low, angling his body in toward the man as the arc of a passing\nheadlight cuts too close for comfort. “I don’t know who you are or what you want from me,\nbut I’m not in the businesses of letting things that can hurt me walk free. So either you tell\nme what’s really going on, or I do what I gotta do to make sure I don’t have a stalker on my\ntail when I leave this place.”\nHis gaze flits around Dean’s face like shadows passing over a riverbed. “It’s so difficult for\nyou to trust already, isn’t it?” he asks. “Even so young.”\nThat wild thing in Dean makes his throat hot. “I ain’t alive because I trust people,” he growls.\n\nFor a moment more, the man is quiet. He is guarding Dean’s front from the acerbic air like a\nfurnace. \n“My name is Castiel,” he says finally. “I am, for all intents and purposes, an angel of the lord.\nI’m from the future. I have—I have known you for a great many years, Dean. I have fought\nbattles at your side. I have saved you, and been saved by you in return.” His voice dips lower,\nrough like a gravel road. “I have sacrificed everything for you, and I would do it again.”\nJohn would tell Dean to kill him. Don’t think twice. Pull the trigger. \nJohn isn’t here. \nSlowly, Dean lowers his gun. \nThere is something about him. There is something—Dean lowers the gun but doesn’t let go\nof his shoulder, and the smile Castiel gives him at that makes Dean’s skin heat. \n“We’re not done,” Dean says roughly. The gun is lowered, but still very much in his hand.\nCastiel could be a shapeshifter, a skinwalker, a ghoul. He could be a demon. He could be a\nthousand things Dean hasn’t heard of yet, sent here in the shape of a man who looks more\nlike a tax accountant than any kind of monster, here speaking devotion to Dean that he\ndoesn’t want to hear. “But it’s cold as shit out here. Walk ahead of me and get in the car when\nI tell you to, and don’t try anything funny.”\n“Of course,” Castiel says. “Nothing ‘funny.’”\nHe emphasizes the last word carefully, as if he’s testing out its colloquialism on the tip of his\ntongue and finding it strange-shaped. He lets Dean turn him around with no hesitation at all,\npresenting his back to him fearlessly. \nDean stares at him for a moment. The back of his neck, pale above his collar and beneath the\nends of his mussed hair. A tender place for a bullet to slip into. \nI have saved you, and been saved by you in return. \nDean nudges Castiel between the shoulder blades, walks him like that from their dark corner\nto where the Impala is parked beneath a streetlight. \nCastiel glances back at Dean over his shoulder as he slides into Baby’s passenger seat, as if\nnot staring at him for the thirty seconds it took to cross the parking lot was some kinda\nhardship. He’s careful where he touches the car, hands gentle, almost reverent; it’s true,\nhonest respect with which Castiel pulls Baby’s door shut behind him. Like he knows her.\nKnows what she means to Dean. \nHis eyes track Dean as he moves around the front of the car. \nDean’s got a silver knife in his duffel in the back, and a vial of holy water. He gets behind the\nwheel and twists until he can grab them, then he holds his hand out for Castiel’s, fixing his\nface into a scowl that he hopes won’t invite any argument. \n\nCastiel complies immediately. Even rolls his sleeve up a bit, courteous and succinct. Like\nhe’s done this before. \nDean’s pulse is still doing something nasty in the side of his neck, throbbing fast beneath his\nskin. He takes Castiel’s wrist in his hand, and Castiel’s palm is big and wide and warm, and\nDean makes a neat slice across his life-line. \nBlood bubbles up sluggishly. Castiel doesn’t even wince. \nHe’s sitting turned completely toward Dean, one knee resting on the seat; as he breathes, the\nshallow cut knits itself back together before Dean’s eyes. \nDean grits his teeth. Upends the holy water over Castiel’s healing flesh. \nNothing. It runs off him like rain, puddles in a dark spot in a fold of his coat. \n“Alright,” Dean says. Even to his own ears he sounds grim. But Jesus—it’s been a hell of a\ngoddamn day, and by the looks of it, it won’t be slowing down any time soon. “Sit still.” \n \nCastiel just looks at him, one eyebrow lifting into an arch, as if to wryly ask Dean what else\nhe would be doing. Dean can think of a couple things. Gouring him to death with a knife,\nmainly, or possessing him and making him steer Baby off the nearest cliff. \nDean scowls again. He stretches past Castiel’s lap to root around in the glovebox, where he’s\ngot the salt stored; he ignores the solid line of heat Castiel makes, gently warming Dean’s\nside. \nHis injured side. He’d forgotten all about it in the wake of Castiel and his bold claims and his\ntragic eyes, but it goes sharp-white with pain as he straightens up. \nCastiel frowns at him. “Are you hurt?”\n“No,” Dean says shortly. He grabs a handful of salt and tosses it Castiel’s way, internally\nmourning all that he’s gonna hafta do to get that out of Baby’s interior. Castiel blinks his eyes\nshut as it hits them, and then back open, brushing grains smartly off of his lapels. \n“Dean,” he says. Castiel speaks Dean’s name like it fits nicely in his mouth. Like he’s said it\na thousand times. “I saw your expression.”\nIgnoring him, Dean shoves the bag of salt into one of the cupholders, his other hand still\nhovering pessimistically over his gun. It’s not quite midnight; Bobby’ll probably still be up,\ndrinking himself to sleep in front of one of those shitty documentaries he likes to watch, and\nif anybody’s gonna know anything about angels it’ll be him. Would’ve been nice if he’d\nmentioned something like that before, though— \n“Dean,” Castiel says, more insistent this time, enough of an edge to it that Dean’s helpless to\nlook up. \nDean was right earlier. Castiel’s eyes are still a bit damp, a bit red around the rims like he’d\nbeen crying about something before he decided to go all Fatal Attraction on Dean’s ass.\n\nPeople don’t—nobody—it’s not—nobody looks at Dean like that. Like there’s nothing else\nthey’d rather see. \nSo close that Dean feels flayed, skin from blood from bone. \n“May I heal you?\nWhat the absolute hell. Dean thinks of the way Castiel’s skin had knit itself back together\neffortlessly, leaving not so much as a smear of blood in its place. He wants to do that to\nDean? He wants to take away the evidence of his own recklessness, this injury that he wears\nas a hallmark of his own mistake, as if it had never happened in the first place?\nNo, Dean thinks. No, no, and then “Why?” is what comes out of him instead. \nCastiel looks confused for a moment—a slim little line between his eyebrows—and then\nsorrowful. It’s uncomfortable enough that Dean shifts where he sits. \n“Because you are in pain,” Castiel says. “And you do not deserve to be.”\nThis is blatantly untrue. Were it some other injury, maybe, some other poor fool’s mistake\nthat had cost Dean and John their hunt, Dean might not feel this hot sour rebellion rising to\nthe back of his throat at those words—but it isn’t anybody’s fault but Dean’s own. He’s the\none who let himself flag, let his exhaustion get in the way of his common sense; he took one\nmoment to rest during a restless job, and the ghoul they were after got the jump on him.\nThat’s how this shit works. \n“That’s not your job to decide,” he says tightly. Castiel is sitting too close. He’s warmer than\nthe heat pumping out of Baby’s vents. “And—how am I supposed to trust you? For all I know\nyou could lay a hand on me and burn me to death, if you’re really an angel like you say.\nWhich I still don’t buy, by the way.”\n“I would never hurt you voluntarily, Dean,” Castiel says. There’s too much weight in the way\nhe stares. He seems genuinely bothered by the prospect, too, in a way that makes Dean’s\nthroat dry. “But I suppose it’s reasonable of you not to believe me, given the life you lead.\nWhat could I... what could I do to convince you?”\n“Of the angel part or the time travel part?” Dean asks, and there’s a definite snap in his voice.\nHe wants to tell Castiel to get out of his car and never bother him again. He wants to know\nwhy Castiel says his name like it’s his favorite word. “Oh I dunno, Castiel, smite something.\nTell me something only I would know.”\nCastiel tips his head, as if he’s seriously considering either of those options. Dean has time to\nworry about more than a little salt ruining the Impala’s leather before Cas says, “You are less\nangry that Sam left you and your father than you are that Sam is the one who got out.”\nThe air goes still around them. Heavy. \nDean’s fists are clenched so tightly that his nails cut into his palms. \n“Keep Sam out of this,” he growls. \n\n“I would never hurt him either,” Castiel says, slow and measured and calm. “Sam Winchester\nis my friend, too, and on top of that he is one of the best men to whom I have ever had the\npleasure of being acquainted.” \nThis gives Dean pause—and something tells him that Castiel knew it would. He says,\nkeeping his voice as hard as he can make it, “You know Sammy too?”\n“I have known the both of you for over a decade,” Castiel murmurs. He smiles slightly, and\nit’s somber. “When I come from, at least.”\n“So he, uh.” Dean wipes the salt from his palm onto his jeans, looking for an excuse not to\nhave to meet Castiel’s probing gaze. “He comes back.\"\nAnother car passes them by. It washes Castiel in pale yellow light. \n“Yes, Dean,” Castiel says quietly. \nDean nods. His side really does hurt. “He happy about that?”\nCastiel’s hesitation tells him all he needs to know. \n“I really don’t think I should reveal much more about your future, Dean,” he says\napologetically. “I don’t—it is unprecedented, what has happened to me to put me here with\nyou. I don’t want to alter the course of your life.”\nGod, of course. Dean meets a time traveling entity who’s maybe the only person in the world\nthat can give him any kinda information on the little brother who won’t answer his calls, and\nthe dude refuses to speak. Even though Sam is apparently some sort of saint in the future or\nsomething—and Dean can buy it. Sammy’s always been the good one out of the two of them,\nthe just one, the kind one. The one who thinks to comfort a victim’s family before jumping in\nto ask them how their loved one was killed. \nThe one who got out. \nThe one who gets dragged back in. \n“So what did happen?” Dean asks. He stares through the darkness beyond Baby’s headlights\nto the bar he’d been wallowing in thirty minutes ago, the trickle of people leaving it on\nunsteady legs. “Assuming you’re not makin’ all this up, which I’m still not convinced of, by\nthe way.”\nAnother hesitation, where Castiel stares at Dean until he goes warm again inside. “Perhaps I\nshould save that story for another time. It seems that you have had quite the day, and this is a\nlot to take in.”\n“What makes you think I’m gonna let you hang around long enough for there to be another\ntime?” Dean asks, but he sounds more weary than truly upset, and the way Castiel looks at\nhim like he knows it makes his ears burn. \n\n“I think that your curiosity will win out over your instinct for self-preservation,” Castiel tells\nhim. He doesn’t quite smile, but the corners of his eyes go soft. “Fortunately in this instance,\nthat’s not a foolhardy decision, although I certainly wish it was a trait you would work on\novercoming.”\nJesus. This guy talks like he more than just knows Dean—he talks like he knows every part\nof him. It’s... strange, to say the least. The flayed-back feeling persists. \n“Shut up,” Dean says, and then “You gotta leave before Dad gets back.” It isn’t a yeah,\nCastiel, you can stick around, but it also isn’t a no, and of that they’re both aware. “He ain’t\ngonna be choosy with the bullets, if you know what I mean.”\nCastiel hasn’t exactly been restless before, but Dean notices it anyway when he goes still. \n“John Winchester,” Castiel says. If Dean’s name in his mouth sounds treasured, John’s\nsounds reviled. “Are the two of you no longer traveling together?”\nThe burn-out ache in his ribs. “Apparently not.”\nThey’d been in the same hotel room—paid for for two nights, a rare luxury—but John had\nheld the keys, and he’s skipped town by now. It’s certainly not the worst punishment John\nWinchester has ever doled out, but it’s far from the most convenient: Dean’s gonna need to\nfind another cheap motel in the area if he doesn’t want to sleep in the Impala injured like he\nis, and he can only hope this Castiel guy brought a wallet with him from the future because\nDean didn’t have time to make any money tonight and he sure can’t afford two rooms. \n“Did he leave you behind?” Castiel asks. \nFor the first time, he sounds upset. It’s slight—a tightening to his voice, a bit more of a rasp\nthan usual—but Dean catches it easily. What the hell does an angel have to be upset about\nsome guy’s dad leaving town?\n“He had his reasons,” Dean says. He doesn’t know why he’s jumping in to defend John just\nlike he always does. He doesn’t know why it’s this—the unwarranted and unwanted concern\nin Castiel’s face, the indignation on Dean’s behalf—that is making Dean’s eyes prickle hot.\nGoddamn mortifying is what it is. “I fucked up. Moved too slow, nearly got us both killed.\nHe’s right to be pissed.”\nHe starts Baby and maneuvers her smoothly out of his spot. The low rumble of her engine\ncalms him, like a strange sort of lullaby. \n“You don’t deserve to hurt, Dean,” Castiel says softly into the space between them.  \nDean’s shoulders are too tight, and his jaw and his hips and his spine. He seeks out the blank\ndarkness of the highway as if it’ll hold him in. “What are you, a fucking shrink?”\n“No. I’m an angel of the lord, so you should listen to what I say.”   \nDean snorts. He’s pretty sure Castiel wasn’t angling for a laugh, but neither of them wanna\nsee the other reaction Dean’s wavering on the edge of. \n\n“Look, man,” he says, and it comes out mean, an edge to it, but one more bump in the road of\nthis day might just shake Dean apart and he’s gotta use what armor he has, “you may know\nfuture me, but you sure as hell don’t know me now. So stay out of it, ok?”\nCastiel is silent for one moment, two, three. Dean can feel Castiel looking at him. Dean\nrefuses to look back. \nHe turns up the music and he drives. \n \n*\n \nDean pulls off at the first motel he sees that looks to be about his price range: one of those\nthat’s just called MOTEL, half the letters in the vacancy sign blinking out, cracks in the\nbarren pavement outside the width of Dean’s forearm.\n“Got money for a room?” Dean asks gruffly. \nThey’ve been quiet for the ride over. Dean’s not sure if Castiel is mad at him or John or if\nhe’s sitting there plotting Dean’s murder; still, Dean can’t help but feel like he’s done\nsomething wrong. \nIt’s a cold, heavy feeling, and it sinks down into his bones. It’s familiar. \n“I don’t sleep,” Castiel says, and Dean must make a face because Castiel clarifies, “No angel\ndoes. So I can... I suppose I can wait out here in the Impala for you until morning if you are\nuncomfortable sharing a space with me—”\n“Not gonna leave you out here in my damn car,” Dean says, twisting the keys in the\ntransmission and pocketing them. It probably says something about him that he’d rather risk\nhis own life by falling asleep in the same room as an all-powerful entity than give that entity\nthe chance to steal his car, but it’s something Dean isn’t willing to examine. Not on this\ndogshit day. “You can take the couch. Or something.”\n“Thank you, Dean.”\nDean doesn’t take out his gun as they cross the parking lot. He’s sure Castiel notices. \nIf he does, he gives no comment. \nDean goes to give Castiel first shift in the bathroom—like he’s John, like he’s human—\nbefore he catches himself with that heat in his chest again. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. You\ndon’t extend showering courtesy to a guy who stalked you in a bar, even if you are having\none of those days where you feel like you gotta repent for every little thing. \nCastiel, already seated at the rickety desk chair in the corner, looks at Dean from beneath\nheavy lids. The smile he gives him is fond. The smile he gives him is for another man. \n\nDean grabs the cleanest clothes he can find in his duffel and shuts the bathroom door tight\nbehind him. \nThe water pressure is weak, sputtering. He turns it as hot as it’ll go and steps in close to the\nwall. Leans his forehead against it. Shuts his eyes. \nIt fucking hurts. The gash along his side. It hurts and—and Dean knows he’s lucky the wound\nisn’t deeper, or further down over the soft fragile flesh of his stomach, he knows he’s damn\nlucky this is all that happened to him after that stupid, stupid move he pulled— \nHe scrubs at his eyes, harsh. Here in the privacy of this room, the first privacy he’s had since\nDad left him, he feels small and dumb and scared. It’s been years since Dean’s been so busted\nup about being on his own, but it’s different this time. With Sammy gone already and not\ntaking any of his calls, with John so disgusted that he couldn’t even look Dean in the eyes\nbefore he’d left. Just tossed Baby’s keys his way, hands shaking with anger. Hadn’t even\nstayed to help Dean clean his wound. \nNot that Dean needs his goddamn dad to survive—hell, he’s twenty-two, and he’s been on\nhunts by himself before. If he’s being honest, he’s been taking care of Sammy and himself for\nmost of their lives. \nBut Sam isn’t here to take care of anymore. And with just himself to look after, it almost\ndoesn’t seem worth it.  \nDean stands there until the water’s gone cold on him, and it stops running pinkish down the\ndrain. He washes with the tiny, bad-smelling soaps they stock places like with, and dries off\nwith a thin towel, shivering a bit as he climbs out onto the cracked tile floor. \nHe wonders what it would feel like to be healed by an angel. By Castiel. Warm, probably,\nlike the heat that pours in a miasma from Castiel’s skin. \nNot that he’s going to take Castiel up on it. Dean doesn’t know him, and he has some self-\npreservation left. \nAnd he does deserve this. Doesn’t matter what Castiel says. \nHe’s half-asleep by the time he wanders back out to the main room, the hair he was too tired\nto dry dripping cold down his neck. Castiel is still sitting sentinel in his chair: his back is\nstraight and tall, his shoulders broad. He has his feet planted a hips-width apart, and his big\nhands rest atop his thighs. He looks almost relieved to see Dean—again with the sense that he\ndoesn’t like to not be looking at him. \nDean wonders if he’s used to it, in the future where Castiel is from. Used to the low-grade\nfever of Castiel’s blue, blue gaze. \n“You gonna kill me while I sleep?” Dean asks. \nCastiel looks upset by this, and Dean feels a swift flash of guilt. Dean thinks of his insistence\nfrom earlier. I would never hurt you voluntarily, Dean. Voluntarily. Like maybe it’s\n\nsomething he’s been forced to do before. \n“Quite the contrary,” Castiel says softly. “I’ll watch over you. I will keep you safe.”\n“Guardian angel,” Dean says. He wants to scoff. He wants, ridiculously, for it to be true.\n“Right.”\nThere are a lot of things he should be doing right now. He should be salting the windows and\nthe doorframe, he should be trying to contact Dad or Sam or Bobby, he should be drilling\nCastiel for information. He shouldn’t have even let Castiel in this room.\nDean’s pulling his gun out and slipping it underneath his pillow on autopilot, and his knife,\ntoo. He’s climbing beneath the covers. \nHe’s letting Castiel watch him do it. \n“You’re gone tomorrow,” Dean murmurs, eyes slipping closed. The pillow is flat and the\nmattress is lumpy and he is weary down to his bones. “Soon as you answer my questions.”\nThe room is silent save for the sound of their mingled breaths, gentle in the darkness.\n“Goodnight, Dean,” Castiel says. \nThat wasn’t an answer. Dean’s asleep before he can point it out. \n \n*\n \nSomething in the darkness. A shape. A light. \nDean moves forward. \nIt is gray around him, like water-stained granite; for a moment that’s all he can see, and then\nthe grayness resolves itself into walls and a floor, crude and stark. \nDean is in a room. \nIt pulsates with a single repeated sound, over and over again—something ringing and\nrhythmic, like bone on bone. A heartbeat. \nA heartbeat. It surrounds him. It slips up under his skin and nestles in close ‘round the sinew\nof his tendons, and he beats with it. \n \n*\n \n\nDean wakes up. \nHe’s not sure, for a moment that clouds his brain with fear, what startled him awake: the\nmotel room is empty as far as he can see, ugly wallpaper stained lilac with the sunrise,\nnothing watching from the still-shadowed corners. He registers the heaviness of his gun in his\nhand before registers that he’s picked it up at all, but there is no figure looming over him to\naim it at. \nNo ghost seeping in through the window cracks. No John stumbling in drunk through the\ndoor. \nAnd oh—\nNobody. That’s it. Castiel is gone. \nDean just sits for a second and lets his pulse wind down. There’s sweat at the small of his\nback. The nape of his neck. He can hear somebody’s dream-heart sounding in his ears. \nThe front door is unlocked. \nDean’s cold when he slips out of bed and across the room to shove his feet in his boots, but\nhe doesn’t bother grabbing his jacket. He opens the door as quietly as he can, peering out into\nthe hazy pre-dawn. \nCastiel is sitting on the edge of the sidewalk a few paces away. \nThey’re in one of those motels where each room has an outdoor entrance, no need to go\nthrough a lobby—perfect for a hunter, who might be passing through at all hours of the day\ncovered in all manners of substances. Perfect, too, for a breath of fresh air when everything\ninside is getting to be too much. Dean would know. \n“What happened to watching over me?”\nCastiel doesn’t startle, doesn’t turn around. Of course he doesn’t. Dean doesn’t know\nanything about angels, but if this guy really is one, he probably knew the second Dean woke\nup. \n“I can watch over you perfectly well from out here,” Castiel says, confirming Dean’s\nthoughts whether knowingly or not. He glances at Dean when Dean moves to sit beside him a\ncareful couple of feet away, arms wrapped around himself against the chill. Castiel’s eyes are\neven more striking in the daylight—otherworldly. It seems like an angelic enough trait. Or\nmaybe that’s just him. “You are very loud.”\n“Hey,” Dean says, vaguely offended. His sweat is already starting to dry down tacky and\ncold. “I don’t snore.”\nCastiel smiles at him, and it’s strangely indulgent—the crinkles at the corners of his eyes, the\nsoft curve of his mouth. “No, Dean,” he says. “You don’t snore. Your soul is what I was\nreferring to. It is... quite vocal.”\n\nDean stares. He has no clue why the words make him go hot again, flustered like an itch\nbeneath his skin that he can’t scratch, kinda—kinda embarrassed. Bashful, maybe, and Jesus.\nDean Winchester doesn’t get bashful. \nIt’s too fucking early for this. \n“My soul,” he repeats flatly. \n“Indeed.” Castiel’s hands are curved over his knees, his scuffed shoes resting evenly in the\ngravel. He speaks quietly. “I have always found it to be lovely.”\nCastiel looks more tired than he did yesterday in the dark, with shadows hiding out in the\nswoops beneath his eyes, with the permanent echo of a frown across his forehead. Dean\nwonders how far in the future he’s from. Dean wonders if he’s told his own Dean this. \n“God,” Dean says. He should’ve grabbed his jacket before he came out here; he shivers a bit,\nand grips his elbows. “What the hell, Cas.”\nThe nickname slips out before he can think about it, and he searches Castiel’s face quick for\nany sort of annoyance. He finds none. He finds, instead, a measure of that hollowed-out\nsorrow from before that hits him in a place he can’t reach. \n“I don’t apologize for believing so,” Castiel says. The gentle purple light makes his edges\nthin. “Though I am sorry if voicing that makes you uncomfortable.”\n“It’s fine, Castiel,” Dean says. He’s careful to pronounce his full name, wary of making\nCastiel gaze at him like he wants something from Dean that Dean doesn’t understand again.\n“Only, that’s a helluva thing to say to a guy you just met.”\n‘Course, they haven’t just met, according to Castiel. God. \n“Oh, Cas is...” a pause. Castiel’s coat pools around his hips on the dirty pavement. “You may\ncall me Cas, if you’d like.”\nHe doesn’t quite look at Dean when he says it, and that must mean something. It’s gotta. His\nthroat bobs as he swallows, one hand tracing something on the knee of his pants that Dean\ncan’t see. \n“Alright, Cas,” Dean says. He doesn’t say that he won’t be calling him much of anything here\nsoon—sometime overnight it’s become important to Dean that Cas and John never meet, and\nthat means getting Cas out of here as soon as possible. The idea of John letting something\nthat calls itself an angel and claims to know his son walk free is laughable, and Dean ain’t\nwilling to risk it. “Think you can answer a couple questions for me?”\nSomebody a few doors down from them ambles out onto their own stoop, a cigarette held in\nlong gray fingers. Cas glances at them and then at Dean, and the fan of his eyelashes spreads\na shadow over his cheeks. \n“I can try,” he says. “Inside, though.”\n\nHe stands, brushing road dust and parking lot grit off his coat as he does so. He looks down at\nDean. He extends a hand. \nDean takes it. Cas’s palm is warm in his, and broad, and he’s got calluses in different places\nthan the men who have touched Dean before; he pulls Dean easily to his feet. He gives Dean\na look when Dean winces at the bite of pain in his ribs, which Dean ignores, because Dean\ndoesn’t know him. \nHe lets go of Dean when they’re both standing. \nThey go inside. \nThe bed is a wreck from where Dean left it in a hurry, a twist of colorless sheets. The gun sits\nabandoned on the pillow. Dean perches at the foot, and Cas takes the wobbly desk chair\nagain. \n“Ok,” says Dean, and for a second he reminds himself of Sam: gathering up all the loose\nthreads of an event and sorting through them until they make sense. Dean can’t ever wrangle\nthem quite right. Tugs too hard. “So you’re—you’re tellin’ me you’re an angel.”\n“I thought we had been over that,” says Castiel. \n“This is a lot for me, man,” Dean snaps. His eyes are dry from too little sleep, and he’s got a\nmeandering sort of headache crawling beneath his skin. “I don’t—I mean, I’ve been in the\nlife for years. Hunting, seeing all kinds of shit. You’d think that if angels were real I’d have at\nleast heard of one.”\nCas sighs. “Heaven is... taciturn. Secretive. They don’t wish to involve themselves in earthly\nbusiness more often than they have to.”\n“I can think of a couple times I coulda used some heavenly involvement,” Dean mutters. He\nthinks of Mom. He thinks of Sam. \nHe wonders if Cas can tell. If the regret putting lines at the sides of his mouth means\nanything, he can. \n“I know,” Cas says. “One of my greatest regrets is that it took me until I knew you well to see\nthe wrongness with which heaven operates.”\nHe really doesn’t hold back, does he? Dean tries not to look like that statement does much to\nhim. “Right,” he says a bit weakly. “All that stuff about knowing me. What’s that about?\nHow’d we meet? Why did we meet, if heaven don’t like you guys mixing with us?”\nThe look on Cas’s face tells Dean he won’t be satisfied by his answer, but he groans when he\nhears it anyway. “I don’t think I should tell you that, Dean.”\nDean lets himself scowl. “You can’t just storm in here and tell me I’m bosom buddies with a\nfucking angel in the future and not offer any explanation,” he says. “What’s to keep me from\njust ganking you right here? How am I supposed to believe anything you say?”\n\n“I didn’t choose to be ripped from my timeline, I’ll have you know,” Cas says, and for the\nfirst time there’s some heat behind his words. He looks upset again, and his hands are\nrestless. It’s difficult, just looking at him right now, to think him anything other than utterly\nhuman. “I expected something entirely different, in fact. So forgive me if I am not well-\nversed in how to deal with a situation of this sort. Right now, ensuring that your future is\nunharmed is of more importance to me than answering your questions.”\n“Whatever, dude. Sorry, I guess,” Dean says, oddly chastened. There is something so sincere\nabout Cas, so genuinely worried, that Dean Winchester, known pusher, isn’t gonna push. \nThe light outside the window is starting to sharpen up into a flat winter day, the color of\ngunmetal and cold just to look at. It turns Cas monochromatic there in his corner, sketchy\ndark lines like a charcoal drawing. He sighs again, looking at Dean. Looking. \n“Heaven has a plan for you,” he murmurs, and it’s a second hand extended: appeasement. Not\nquite successful. “Something that neither you nor I could stop, in any timeline. It is the\nreason you and I meet at all.”\nDean snorts, incredulous. He thinks of his coarse, hard body, the gun on his pillow, the\nalcohol in his veins. The blood on his hands. “Heaven don’t want anything to do with a guy\nlike me,” he says. \nCas is unwavering. Softly, he says, “You’re wrong.”\n“Yeah, ok.” Dean rubs at the ridge of his knuckles. He sounds like he doesn’t believe Cas,\nand he leaves it that way. “Sure.”\nThere are a thousand things he wants to ask Cas that lay quivering on the tip of his tongue,\nalmost too tangled to parse through. He wants to ask what kinda guy he is in the future, and if\nhe’s still hunting, and if Sam is happy. He wants to ask how Castiel got here, to him. He\nwants to ask how close they are. If Cas is someone Dean leans on. \nHe doesn’t. Can’t, maybe. Like maybe he’s scared of the answers. \nI have sacrificed everything for you, Cas had told him. And I would do it again. \n“So uh,” Dean says. The dream-heartbeat has faded, and he didn’t notice when. “How old are\nyou?”\nIt’s a stupid question, and Dean only half cares, but Cas appears to consider this with all the\ngravity that he considers everything else. “I am older than the ground itself,” he tells Dean at\nlast. “I am older than human comprehension.”\n“Oh. Um, you look about forty.”\nThat small smile again. “Thank you, Dean. I’ve found that this vessel retains its moderately\nhandsome appearance remarkably well considering what I have put it through.”\nThere is so much in that sentence to be hung up on that Dean decides to think about none of it\nvery hard. Tries not to, at least: thinks, with an itch in his palms, that Castiel is a whole lot\n\nmore than moderately handsome, and chews on the soft skin of his lip until it tastes like\ncopper. \n“Well,” he says. “Well. Good.”\n“Mm,” says Cas. He tilts his head, lips parted for a moment before he provides voice to his\nthoughts. “And you. How old are you now, Dean?”\n“I’ll be twenty-three at the end of the month,” Dean says, and then tries not to blush, unsure\nwhy he said it that way. Like a little kid eager to announce his birthday to somebody older\nand cooler than him. \nCas unbalances the hell outta him.\n“So young,” Cas says quietly. He had said something like that last night, too, when Dean had\nhim pressed up in the shadow of that bar with a gun on his pulse. He is marveling at it. \nDean hasn’t felt young since he was born.  \n“Jesus,” he says, digging his heels into the carpet, “Cas, s’not like I can’t drink yet or\nsomethin’.”\n“No, pardon me, of course not,” Cas says dryly, “that would mean you were one year and\neleven months younger than you are now. A veritable infant. How could I be so foolish.”\n“Fuck off,” Dean says, wrongfooted and unclear how he feels about it. He’s saved from\nanswering by his phone ringing from his jacket pocket across the room.\nHe holds up a finger in Cas’s direction— stay —though Cas seems disinclined to cut up and\nrun again, even just for some fresh air. His eyes are still on Dean when Dean fishes his phone\nfree and checks to see who’s calling. \nDad. \nHe’s been—it’s been—this morning’s been ok. His side feels like it’s stuffed full of hot coals\nand there’s an angel across the room with a fuckin’ mouth on him, but considering how\nyesterday went, Dean’s been alright today. Maybe even calm. \nNot so now. Those three letters shoot his heart somewhere up in the back of his throat, big\nand beating fast for him to choke on. \n“Hey,” he says, turning to face the wall. “Dad, hi.”\n“Got a lead on a hunt down in Illinois,” John says.\nDean’s used to no introduction when Dad calls him, no hello; the guy’s busy. Don’t have time\nfor shit like that. “Alright,” Dean says, hating the way his voice forces itself deeper just ‘cuz\nof the man on the other end of the line. “Need me to meet you somewhere?”\nJohn is silent for a beat too long.\n\n“Going at it alone this time,” he says, gruff. Dean can hear the roar of the highway behind\nhim, something playing loud and tinny over the speakers. AC/DC, maybe. “‘Bout time you\nlearned how to take care of yourself anyway. Get a couple solo kills under your belt. Figure\nout how to survive without your old man.”\nThe plastic of the phone is cold against Dean’s hot cheek, hard in his hand. Dean stares at the\ndirt ground down into the baseboard. Swallows, tight. \n“Yessir,” he mumbles. \n“What was that?”\n“Yes, sir,” he says, louder. His spine is so straight that it hurts. \n“Can’t make stupid mistakes when there’s no one there to cover for you, ain’t that right?”\nDean thinks of the look on John’s face when he saw that ghoul on Dean. Anger, pure and\nsimple. Dean thinks of the way he’d killed it right there on top of Dean, so its blood got on\nhis skin. \nBreathe in. Out. “Yes, sir.”\n“That’s what I thought,” John says. “I’ll find you when I need you, son. This’ll be good for\nyou.”\n“Yes, sir,” Dean says, but the line goes dead before he’s finished. \nCastiel is standing behind him when Dad hangs up. Dean can feel him. A disruption of air. \nDean has had a lifetime to develop the skill of knowing who is standing at his vulnerable\nspine. \nHe turns around. He is holding the phone so tightly that it cuts into the meat of his palm,\ncheap plastic straining; Cas’s face, when Dean can look at him, is wearing an expression so\nforeign that he can’t name it with a glance. \n“Dean—”\n“Where are you going?” Dean interrupts. His voice is still that low-down scrape, older than\nhimself. He drops his gaze to Cas’s shoes. “After this. Back to where you’re from?”\nCas is quiet for a moment too long. The weight of what he wants to say rests between them,\npushing at the air. Pushing. Dean thinks of the way he’d scowled at John’s name last night;\nDean thinks of a curled fist. \n“No,” Cas says finally. Just that. \nDean makes his smile like a knife. “Wanna hit the road?”\n\nChapter End Notes\ni fucked around and indeed i found out. i am on twitter where i cry a lot and also tumblr\nwhich i don't know how to use and i'd love to talk to you <3\n\nChapter 2\nChapter Summary\nWhen Dean Winchester was sixteen years old he kissed a boy behind a bar.\nChapter Notes\nmind the tags everybody. nothing graphic, but i want everybody to take care of\nthemselves!\nWhen Dean Winchester was sixteen years old he kissed a boy behind a bar. \nThe children of parents who like to drink know how to entertain themselves in the back of a\nparked car. The oldest children of parents who like to drink know how to make it seem like\nthat’s ok. \nDean was good at it: he was an expert at keeping Sammy occupied for forty-five minutes\nwith a handful of Army men and a quick imagination by the time he was five. Hell—he\ntaught the kid to read like that, in the back of the Impala behind a series of dives, struggling\nwith a copy of The Hobbit he’d stolen off a library shelf in Lexington. Until Dean and Sam\nwere old enough to follow John inside without getting suspicious looks, they passed their\ntime outside together, and they got on just fine. \nUntil a podunk town outside Cincinnati. Until some other kid waiting for some other father in\nthe passenger seat of a sedan, watching Dean through the window. \nJohn went back three nights in a row—the case was falling through, full of dead ends: a\nmother and her children burned to death in their beds, too close to his past for sobriety—and\nthe kid was there each time. He had dark hair and a mouth that didn’t smile. \nOn the third night he slipped out of the sedan and curved around the back of the bar, throwing\nDean one last glance. \n“Just a minute, Sammy,” Dean mumbled, one foot already out the door. \n“Dean?” Sam asked. He had his nose in a book. He always did, at twelve. “Where’re you\ngoing?”\n\n“Gotta piss,” Dean said, which couldn’t have been further from the truth; and he shut the\ndoor quiet behind him, and felt like his feet weren’t part of him as he followed the boy. \nHe had slender wrists and his hand on Dean’s cheek was warm. \nJohn didn’t say anything when he found them. He’d smelled like whiskey as he dragged\nDean back through the gravel, and his hand had shook as he boxed Dean’s ears. \n“Do not,” said John quietly, like a thunderclap, and Dad wasn’t angry, Dean thought then—he\nwas devastated. “Leave your brother alone. Ever. Do you want something to happen to him?\nIs that what you want, Dean?”\nI don’t know what I want, Dean thought. Even then, it was a lie. \nJohn had Dean drive them back to the motel. Dean kept one hand curled inward like a fist on\nhis lap, nails sunk down deep into his skin so he wouldn’t cry. \nThe boy’s mouth had been soft. \nThree months later Dean turned seventeen. John gave him the first birthday gift he’d given\nDean since the shotgun when he was six: a solo hunt. \nIt was just a salt-and-burn—easy. The kinda stuff he’d been doing practically since he could\nwalk. \nTwo nuns haunted a church in Wyoming. They’d loved each other. They were in love with\neach other. \nThey had been caught, and they’d killed themselves before anybody else could do it. \nDean wasn’t sent on a solo hunt for a long time after that. \nHe never touched another boy. \n \n*\n \nThis is what it means to hunt on your own: I am disappointed in you. You are wrong. \nYou are wrong. \n \n*\n \n\nCas doesn’t say a word as Dean loads them both back into the Impala and peels out of the\nmotel lot. \nDean doesn’t know where he’s going—just that he needs to go. Needs to get some distance\nbetween himself and this fucking town, and hear the roar of the highway beneath his wheels\nwhile he’s doing it. He slams a tape into the deck without checking to see what it is first and\nhe turns the volume up high.  \nMetallica. He’s too tense to drum out the opening rhythm of “Enter Sandman” but he feels it\nrushing right there under the surface of his skin anyway, like a current—like something he\ncan let sweep him away. \nCastiel is watching and he is making no move to hide it. Dean keeps his eyes on the blur-\nblack road.\nA couple of hours pass with nothing but James Hetfield’s voice filling up Baby’s cabin. The\nsun has turned the world as bright and frigid as a frozen lake, and there’s a loose bundle of\nswollen gray snow clouds gathered on the horizon; Dean turns off at the next exit he sees,\nand out of the corner of his eye he watches Cas sit up straighter. \nHe turns the music down. “Hungry?”\n“Angels don’t eat, either.”\nDean makes a sharp noise. “What do you do?”\n“Me specifically,” Cas asks, and it’s calm but there’s wryness under that thunderstorm voice,\n“or my kind?”\n“Got a feeling you’re not much like the rest of your kind,” Dean says. He glances at Cas. \nHere, in the harsh metallic daylight, with Cas’s cheekbones all lit up and his irises\nshimmering, he’s back to ethereal: maybe Dean doesn’t believe him about being an angel\nquite yet, but in the way he looks now it’s easy to start falling for it. \nHe catches Dean staring with a lift of an eyebrow. Dean’s throat goes hot and he looks out the\nwindshield again. \n“Me specifically, then,” Cas says. He hums soft, from his chest. “For the first several\nmillennia of my existence I would have classified myself as a soldier. Dutiful and obedient—\nand numb. I had no agency, no thought to do anything but what my Father had writ.” \nA pause. Dean pulls into the diner right off the exit, parking close to the doors. “Then what?”\nThe corner of Cas’s mouth lifts. “Then I met you.”\n \n*\n\n \nDean ain’t hungry but he orders himself a burger and fries anyway, because he gets bitchy\nwhen he doesn’t eat and he needs to keep a little charm about him if he wants to wrangle any\nmore info out of Cas today. \n“And for you, sir?” the waitress asks, leaning her hip on the edge of the table with her\nnotepad open. She’s pretty enough, soft brown hair and hips that would fit nicely in the curve\nof Dean’s palms—but it clearly isn’t him she’s looking at. \nHe doesn’t think Cas notices. The guy has been gazing out the window at the looming storm\nclouds while Dean orders, holding his menu open but not bothering to scan it. When she\nspeaks to him he looks up with a polite, if vague, glance, and there’s nothing like the few\nsmiles he’s given Dean so far lingering around the shape of his mouth. \n“A coffee for me, please,” he says. “And a slice of whatever pie you think is best.”\n“Sure thing, sweetie,” she says. Her fingers graze the back of his hand as she takes his menu,\nand her eyes roam the line of his shoulders long after it’s appropriate. \nDean clears his throat. Cas’s attention comes to rest back on him, steady and close. \n“Gotta make a call,” Dean says. Now that he has begun speaking, he can’t figure out why he\ndid in the first place. Not like he needs Cas’s permission or anything. Still, when Cas nods at\nhim and settles back onto the slick red vinyl of the booth, Dean doesn’t tell him to turn away. \nBobby picks up on the last fucking possible ring like he does every goddamn time Dean calls\nhim. \n“You better not be in any trouble,” Bobby says, rather than anything like a hello. “Don’t feel\nlike having to come rescue your sorry ass.”\n“Why?” For the first time since they left the motel, something all knotted up and ugly at the\nbase of Dean’s spine unwinds a little. Gives him a little room to breathe. “Hot date?”\n“That’s for me to know and you to find out,” Bobby grumbles. “Nah, I just hate doing your\ndad’s job for him.”\nDean winks at the waitress as she sets down their coffees—instinct—but she doesn’t even\nturn his way. “Don’t wanna talk about that, Bobby,” he says. \nBobby’s quiet for half a second, doesn’t jump in immediately with some kind of insult or\ncomplaint; Dean’s heart sinks down into his belly. \n“I’m serious, old man,” he says. Across the table from him, Cas has stirred three packets of\nsugar into his joe and is working on a fourth, eyes never leaving Dean. There is a faint frown\non his face. Dean scowls at him—that’s instinct, too. “We ain’t talkin’ about that. You let it\ngo or I’m hanging up.”\n“You called me, dipshit,” Bobby says, but he shuts up. \n\n“That’s more like it.” Dean kicks Castiel when he reaches for a fifth, making an unintelligible\nmotion that Cas somehow manages to interpret as give it here. He does: places it just-so in\nthe soft dip of Dean’s palm. “Hey, what do you know about angels?”\n“Angels?” Bobby repeats doubtfully. “Little kids with fluffy wings?”\n“That’s cherubs,” Dean says, rolling his eyes broadly. “Nah, I’m talking angels -angels. Like,\ncame-down-from-heaven-with-a-fucking-agenda angels.” \nThis time Bobby’s silence is as judgemental as a silence can be. “You been drinking, boy?”\nDean sighs, emptying the contents of the sugar packet into his coffee and stirring it with his\nspoon. “It’s one pm.”\n“Ain’t ever stopped you before.”\n“Not drinking. Just... curious.”\n“Damn moron,” Bobby grunts, and then makes the sound he always makes when he sits\ndown on that couch Dean’s been saying is too low for his old back for years. “Well, short\nanswer’s no.”\n“Long answer?”\n“Long answer is that there’s a shitload of lore on angels but none of it’s ever been proven,\nand no hunter’s ever seen one before. All a bunch of hooey if you ask me.”\n“Yeah,” Dean says. He tries not to feel disappointed. He tries not to think about why he\ndoesn’t just tell Bobby about Cas outright. “Thanks, Bobby.”\nBobby snorts. “Sure.” There’s the low mumble of patchy voices on his end, like the TV’s\nturned on low. “And Dean? Listen. You call me if you get into any trouble. You hear? I might\nnot like doin’ John Winchester’s job but dammit, I will if I need to.”\n“Yeah, Bobby,” Dean mutters, dipping his head even though he’s not here to see. “I’ll keep\nyou posted.”\n“I know you will,” Bobby says. “Bye, Dean.”\n“Bye.”\nWhen he looks up, Cas is sipping his disgusting coffee slowly, cup cradled in both big hands.\nHe’s watching Dean archly over the rim. \n“You’re pouting,” Cas says. \n“Absolutely I am not, what the hell,” Dean mutters. Their waitress deposits his burger in\nfront of him without preamble, and slides Cas’s pie across to him with a little grin. Dean digs\nin before he says something that’ll get him in trouble, chewing as she walks away. “I didn’t\nthink he’d have anything.”\n\n“You wanted him to,” Cas says. Not a question. “You wanted to prove me right.”\nThe burger is kinda dry and kinda tough and sits heavy in Dean’s stomach. “Yeah, well,” he\nsays. He nudges his fries, which are pale and unappealing. “Me not wanting the guy I’m\nletting ride around in my car to be a lying crazy person ain’t anything to write home about,\nCas.”\n“I suppose not,” says Cas. “It took you a while to believe me in the future, too.”\nCas still has that big ugly coat on even though they’re inside, fitted snug at his shoulders but\nloose all down his sleeves. Dean, who feels weirdly hot in an intangible kind of way even\nthough it’s freezing outside, had shrugged out of his leather jacket the moment they walked\nin. \nHe wonders if Cas knows he radiates body heat like a supernova. He wonders if future Dean\nhas ever told him. \n“What convinced me?”\n“I believe it was mostly necessity,” Cas says. He still hasn’t touched his pie, and he’s got that\ndistant sheen in his gaze that descends when he talks about... his Dean. The Dean who\nknows him. The Dean he got taken away from. “There was so much going on at the time that\nI believe it was simpler for you just to accept who I was.”\nHe gets that now, on some level. There’s never really been a time in his life when there isn’t a\nlot going on, so it makes sense that he’d just compartmentalize and move on. Especially if\nCas was helpful to whatever he was trying to do—which hasn’t been proven, but as kind as\nhe has been to Dean in the eighteen hours since Dean’s known him, it’s easy to believe.\n“And you still don’t wanna tell me how we meet?” Dean asks. He forces himself to finish the\nburger, but he abandons the fries. Lost cause. “Not even a hint?”\nThe indulgent smile again. He looks like he’s seconds away from telling Dean his soul is\nbrighter than any of the stars in the sky, or something; Dean braces himself, although he can’t\ndecide if he wants to hear it or not. \n“No, Dean,” Cas says. He reaches out and pulls Dean’s plate toward him, switching it with\nhis slice of pie—lemon meringue, looks like. There’s a fork balanced on the edge, and Dean\nblinks at it dumbly. “I hope you’ll accept this as a consolation prize.”\n“Dude, I’m not gonna—I mean, that’s yours, you don’t have to—\n“Dean,” says Cas. God, his eyes. He tips his head, a little quirk to his mouth. “Angel,\nremember?”\nDean’s laugh wobbles out of him, just a breath. “Yeah,” he says, picking up the fork. “I\nremember.”\n \n\n*\n \nCas is actually not a bad person to roadtrip with. \nHe doesn’t try to fuck with the music, and he doesn’t complain about whatever Dean plays.\nSometimes he mouths the words to Dean’s favorite Zep songs beneath his breath like he\nknows them real well, like he loves them too—Dean wonders if this is something he and Cas\nshare in the future, if they listen to music together a lot, the two of them and a tape deck and\nRobert Plant—but he never sings too loud. He doesn’t eat, so Dean doesn’t have to tell him\nnot to throw his trash in the cupholders. When they stop at a gas station Cas fills up Baby’s\ntank without being asked, while Dean runs inside to grab a bottle of ibuprofen for his ribs that\nwon’t stop hurting. \nThe only iffy thing is all that staring, but Dean, he... well. It’s not all that bad. \nIt starts to settle against Dean’s skin like a touch. \nHe pops a few painkillers and swallows them dry as Cas finishes pumping gas. He’s got a\nhigh tolerance, so there are a couple hours left in him, probably, before the pills make him too\nsleepy to drive or those clouds perched menacingly on the horizon decide to open up. After\nthat, well. \nThere’s always something to chase. \nCas slips back into the passenger seat, letting in a blast of cold air and the acrid scent of\ngasoline in with him. Dean shivers when it hits him, cranks up the heat. He thinks Cas sees,\nmaybe. Or maybe he’s just always frowning a little bit. \nHe settles into the Impala with that familiarity Dean noticed yesterday night, one arm up\nalong the window, his hand tapping an absent rhythm on his thigh. She curves around the\nboth of them, warm and safe. A cocoon of metal and well-worn leather. \n“What about Baby?” Dean asks as he pulls back onto the highway. “Do I still have her?”\n“You do,” Cas affirms, bestowing Dean with a smile that is almost bafflingly fond. He and\nDean must be real close friends. Best friends, even. “I don’t think there is a force on this\nearth, supernatural in nature or not, that could convince you to give her up.”\n“Hell no,” Dean says with zeal. There is something nice about hearing Cas refer to Baby like\nthat, like she’s a she, that settles down warm in the same place where the knowledge that Cas\nlikes Zeppelin resides. “She’s my best girl.”\nCas rolls his eyes. Castiel, angel of the lord, rolls his eyes. That’s fond, too.\n“Your attachment to this car is heinous,” he says. \n“My attachment to this car is pure and loving,” Dean says, and skims the flat of his palms\nover her steering wheel. He might be smiling, he thinks. An achievement, after the past\n\ncouple days he’s had. “She’s trusty. Seen us through a lot.”\nMe and Sam, he doesn’t say. It’s been nearly half a year since Sam left, but sometimes it’s\nstill hard to say his name. \nThe two of them quiet down again as Dean drives, letting the sounds of the road and the low-\nlevel music fill the air. \nThe horizon grows blue-black and bruise-shaded as the sun sets and dusk gathers in close,\nelongating the shadows and giving Dean the feeling that it’s much later than the paltry seven\npm it really is. There’s not much of anybody but them on this stretch of road between two\ntowns; four mile markers whiz by before Dean spots another pair of headlights sweeping\nacross the horizon, startling in all this darkness. \nIt’s exactly the kind of night that would’ve lulled him and Sam to sleep easy when they were\nlittle kids, before they grew gun-calluses on their hands. The rocking sway of the Impala. The\nslightly musty heat spilling out of the vents like an exhale. Somebody older and wiser than\nthem in the front seat, who they knew intrinsically would keep them safe. \nAin’t been a night like that in a while. \nIs that what you want, Dean? Dad’s voice comes, that constant beat in the back of Dean’s\nhead. You wanna be small? \nHe is here in the cupped cradle of the highway’s hand. There is an angel in the seat beside\nhim.\nHe wants to be so small that the eye of God can’t see him. \n \n*\n \nUsually he’d just sleep in the passenger seat while Dad drove, the two of them taking shifts\nacross the country until some monster or other required them to stay in one place for a bit,\nand not spring for a motel room two nights in a row. But he doesn’t really know Cas, doesn’t\nknow if all his familiarity with Baby means he can drive her or that he simply appreciates her\nmany qualities, doesn’t know the protocol for asking an angel you just met to get you over\nthe state line while you sleep. \nSo he gets another motel room. \nSpeaking of protocol—it can’t be polite to expect the guy to sit in one of those shitty\nuncomfortable chairs all night. Dean uses the last of the cash he won at a bar a couple nights\nago to get a second bed, bearing the weight of Cas’s gaze on the back of his neck as he does\nso. \n“You didn’t have to do that,” Cas says in a low voice. \n\nHe isn’t touching Dean, but in the narrow hallway he has to walk close, and one of his wide\nshoulders almost grazes Dean’s with every step. \nThe single lightbulb before their door is weak and yellowed. Turns the shadow on Cas’s face\ndeep. \n“No big deal,” Dean mutters, even though he made a very big deal about it the night before.\nHe gets the key in the door, blinking away that strained-wide pall of exhaustion that always\nclings to his eyelids after driving a whole day. “You’ll throw your back out sitting in a chair\nall night.”\nHe has to jostle the door in its frame to get it open; the lock’s all jimmied, scratched up like\nit’s been picked before. It hurts to raise his arm, a beneath-the-surface ache that’s been dulled\nby the painkillers and seems distant right now, unimportant compared to the lure of a mattress\nand some mostly clean sheets. \n“My bones would realign themselves almost before they could even shift from their proper\nform, Dean,” Cas says. He grazes his fingertips across the small of Dean’s back as he moves\npast him and into the room, and the touch feels like a thank you. \nDean doesn’t realize he’s frozen where he stands until Cas throws a quizzical look back at\nhim over his shoulder. \nThat heat bundles up beneath Dean’s jaw. It’s swiftly becoming familiar. \n“Well, ok,” Dean says. He shuts the door and then he heaves his duffel onto the bed closest to\nhim, digging through its contents so he doesn’t have to look up. “Sit on the floor next time,\nStretch Armstrong, see if I care.”\nHe wants very much to crawl into bed and bury himself there for a good four hours, but he\nstill smells like bad diner food and gas and exhaust spilled out into winter air, and he’ll\nscratch his skin off if he doesn’t shower. He stocks his pillow with weapons like usual, he\ndigs out the t-shirt he slept in last night— \n“Oh,” says Cas behind him. A gentle realization. “Thank you, Dean. I should have said.”\nIt should make him feel good, but it makes him feel stupid instead, crumpled like a can\ncrushed under a bootheel. The fact that he was shameless enough in his disappointment over\n—over what? Not being thanked? Like it’s some big thing to get a bed for the person you’re\nsharing a motel room with. Like he needs a goddamn reward every time he does something\ndecent. \n“Sure, yeah, Cas,” Dean says, too offhand. He escapes to the bathroom. \nDon’t be selfish, John had told him years ago. They had just finished up a hunt, and it was\nDean’s seventeenth birthday the next day, and he wanted to take Sammy to the arcade and\nfuck around on the coin-ops for a while, and John had said Don’t be selfish, said you boys\nneed to learn how to shoot better in real life, not in a video game. Had taken them both to the\nrange the next day before handing Dean the keys to the Impala and a case file and telling him\n\nnot to come back until there was nothing left, with a grin and a wink like he was proud. Don’t\nbe selfish. \nThe gouge across Dean’s ribs is red and grim-looking, puffy around the edges, sickly yellow\nwhere it shouldn’t be. Dean looks at it in the mirror and presses it hard, hard, hard, until his\neyes water. \nSammy got Dean three of those sci-fi paperbacks that Dean liked to pretend he didn’t eat up\nlike candy for that birthday. He handed them to Dean all casual, because even at twelve he\nknew that Winchesters didn’t give gifts without subterfuge and enough forced nonchalance to\nsmother a man, unless the gift was something you could use to kill someone else. He stayed\nup with Dean that night too, whispering quietly under the blanket so they didn’t wake John in\nthe next bed, and not saying a damn word about the tremble in Dean’s hands. \nDean’s image is blurred in the mirror. He tugs his shirt on and he goes to sleep, ignoring the\nway Cas stares at him from the next bed over. \n \n*\n \nThe room again. \nThe room—only this time it is so eerily quiet that Dean gasps in a rattling breath that tears at\nhis throat like a sob. \nHe’s never felt grief like this before.\nIt subsumes him. It winnows up beneath his flesh and it crushes him, from the outside and the\ninside, it presses him back back down into the frigid stone floor at his back and his arms. I\nmiss you, Dean thinks, with an emptiness in the bowl of his chest that wails. I’m going to be\nkilled with how much I miss you. \n“Dean,” says a voice, and there’s a moment of terrible hopeless elation that has Dean crying\nout, reaching out, thinking you, you, you— \n“Wake up,” says the voice. “Dean, wake up.” \n \n*\n \nHe does, and it’s like shattering.  \nHe doesn’t reach for his knife or his gun simply because he’s still searching for that person,\nthe owner of that voice, whoever it is who has left him and replaced themselves with a rip in\n\nDean like a rip in the universe. Dean wakes up saying it, saying the name of the person who\nleft him with this exit wound as big as a canyon, wakes up and says “Cas, Cas—”\nCas is on the edge of the bed. He catches Dean’s searching hands in his own, he’s warm, he is\nsaying Dean’s name, he is curved over Dean as if he’s a shield and Dean doesn’t know him\nand Dean can’t fucking breathe with all the things that room made him feel, all of this ache,\nand it was Cas’s name Dean woke up calling. It was Cas who he missed. \n“Dean,” says Cas again, like he’s gentling something feral and afraid. Dean would jerk back\nif he didn’t taste salt and iron on his tongue. “Oh, Dean, please let me heal you.”\nSomething makes him say yes. Dean knows what makes him say yes. \nThe curve of Cas’s palm fits over Dean’s convex ribs, his fingers rest in those uncharted dips\nbetween bone. He touches Dean’s opposite shoulder with his other hand so he’s bracketing\nhim in and then he... he glows. \nHe is beautiful. Untouchably so. There is blue-gold light pouring from him into Dean, filling\nup all his hollow places, taking away the fevered gnaw of his wound and some of that\nterrified petrifying unkillable missing someone pain that makes him gasp again. The light is a\nsunbeam. A solar flare. \nDean has the fabric of Cas’s sleeve pinched tight in his sweaty hand. His fingers relax,\nsubconscious, as Castiel’s light suffuses him, but he doesn’t let go. \nCas’s face is almost too much to look at. \nHe draws back. Dean wants to chase after him. Wants to demand Cas get his hands on Dean\nagain, and not let go. Dean checks his side instead. \nThe skin is unmarred, no hint that there has ever been anything wrong there. \n“God, Cas, I missed you,” Dean rasps. \nIt’s the mightiest frown Dean’s seen on him yet. His eyes flicker all over Dean’s face, less\nsteady than his unerring gaze has ever been, as if there could possibly be any untold injuries\non Dean that he missed. There are none on the outside. \n“Dean,” murmurs Cas. Always saying his name. He must’ve said it a hundred times already\nsince he found Dean in that bar—how many times has he said it in the future? How often has\nhe had to form it on his tongue to make it sound like it was born there? “What do you mean?”\n“In my dream,” Dean says. He feels a little drunk—on the adrenaline rush of waking up like\nthat or on Cas’s healing, he has no idea. Both, maybe. He’s still holding Cas’s sleeve. “I was\n—god, I dunno, Cas. In some kind of gray room, and I was on the floor, and you were gone,\nand it fucking hurt. Like I’d known you forever.”\nLike somebody took you away from me, Dean thinks, but doesn’t say. It’s almost a thought\noutside of him. He hasn’t known Cas long enough to be that devastated by the loss of him.\nThere’s no way. Is there?\n\nCas is just staring at him, his lips parted, his eyes deep in the darkness. “Like a memory,”\nDean says to him. “Felt like I should... like I should’ve known what was missing before you\nsaid my name.”\n“I sensed your nightmare,” Cas tells him, and distress rolls off of him in waves. “But I\ncouldn’t tell what you were dreaming about. Just that you... I could sense, as well, that I\ncould help ease your pain.” He breathes in, and it shakes a little. “I thought that the fever\nfrom your wound was affecting your dreams, giving you nightmares. I’m sorry.”\n“Hey, you didn’t do anything wrong, pal,” Dean tells him. He lets the side of his hand bump\nCas’s. He’s breathing quick, up-and-down jolts of his chest. “You’re probably right. Didn’t\nrealize my ribs were that bad, probably hallucinated or something.”\nHe knows it’s not true even as he says it: thinks of the gray room from his dream the night\nbefore, and the despair that even now tinges the edges of his consciousness.\n“You had let it get infected,” Cas says quietly. “It wasn’t cleaned properly, and you wouldn’t\nlet me heal you the first night we met.”\nHe has a way of listing the things Dean has been an idiot about almost softly, like they’re not\nreally shortcomings at all. It’s ridiculous. Dean wants to know him. \n“That’s what I get then, I guess,” Dean says, and tries to sling his signature careless grin\nCas’s way. He can tell it falls short. The tears on his cheeks are cool in the night air, drying\ninto tracks, and he’s still breathing too hard to be anything but messed up about all this. He\nlets it fall away as quickly as it came. \nCas looks like there are a thousand things he wants to say. He’s still searching Dean like a\nfloodlight, running those eyes over every inch of him, a determined, ceaseless sweep. The\nsorrow is back in that hitch of his breath, in his furrowed brow. It’s worse this time. Dean\nunderstands it this time, even if he doesn’t have the words to make its shape. \n“What was that?” Dean asks him, quieter. “That... light.”\nCas is a foot away, the bed tipping down at the edge with his weight. Half a second of letting\ngo of the tension at the root of Dean’s spine and he’d be tipping over onto him, and maybe\nthen he could catch the glow under Cas’s flesh. \n“It was my grace,” Cas says. “The closest thing to a soul that an angel has, and the source of\nour power.”\nIt had certainly felt that way. Powerful. Dean could have flown for that moment it was\nrushing down his veins. \nHe remembers Cas telling him that his soul is loud and is—is lovely. Jesus Christ. Dean can’t\nimagine anybody’s soul or grace or whatever looking more lovely than Castiel’s had looked\njust now, as incandescent as starfire. Dean has seen a lot of beautiful things, a lot of beautiful\npeople, during his life on the road, and none of them can top what Cas just showed him. Not\none. \n\n“If you can... if you can heal me, and sense my dreams... I mean, I dunno if you know this\nCas, but that’s all a little more impressive than a fucking party trick.” He shakes his head,\nalmost at a loss. It’s difficult to wrap his flimsy human mind around something so holy.\n“You’re powerful, man. Why can’t you use that power to reverse whatever brought you here?\nJesus, don’t waste it on me. Get yourself home.”\n“First of all,” says Cas, letting their hands bump again. Dean’s fingers go lax instinctually,\nand then Cas covers them with their own, and then the two of them are just holding hands.\nHolding hands in the middle of an anonymous dark motel room. “Healing you is not a waste.\nIt is an honor.”\nDean says, weakly, “Oh.”\n“And as for going home, well.” Cas, for perhaps the first time Dean has known him, avoids\nDean’s gaze. He turns it down on their clasped hands, on the overlap of their fingers and\npalms, silvered in the moonlight. “My grace is finite. I have lived a very long and storied life,\nand I have spent time both as an angel and as a human as fallible as yourself. My grace has\nbeen weakened, with transformation and with strain. With sacrifice. Even as I wish to return\nhome—and I do wish it, Dean, more than almost anything—I’m unable to.” He drags the pad\nof his thumb over Dean’s knuckles, a whisper of skin on skin. “Though I didn’t know this\nexactly would be the result of my deal, I did make a deal, and it’s my duty to bear it.”\nThere’s a note running through his voice: something bruised, old blood and desperation. Like\nrecognizes like. \n“You miss him,” Dean says, low. “The Dean you know. You miss him bad.”\nCas smiles at him sadly. “More than I can possibly say.”\nDean doesn’t know how to look at him. Can’t possibly look away. “You guys always\ntogether?”\n“We are apart much more often than I would like,” Castiel says quietly, and keeps up the\ncareful sweep of his thumb, the careful touch. “Often through forces outside of our own\ndesign. Each time it happens I feel this way, but now, knowing that I will never see him\nagain... it’s difficult. More difficult than I could have imagined.”\n“Sorry you got saddled with a shitty stand-in for the real thing,” Dean says, with a horrible\nsoft laugh. \n“ Dean ,” Cas says, sharp enough to be an admonition. It almost looks like he’s angry, but he\nbrings his other hand up and cradles Dean’s tight, leans in closer so the mattress dips. “You\nare the best and most loving person that I have ever known, and whether there are years of\nhistory between us or simply a matter of days, it is evident to me that you burn brighter than I\ncan fathom. I have seen civilizations rise and fall, and I have seen the first living organisms\npry themselves out of the primordial ooze, yet there is nothing— nothing— I have ever seen\nin my very long existence that can compare to you.” He takes in a deep breath, and his eyes\nare shining. “So please do not discount the respect, and the loyalty, and the—the depth of my\nfeelings for you, for every version of you. I miss the relationship that you and I have built for\n\nourselves in the future, born of hard work and trust and a decade of choosing each other over\nand over again, but that does not change the fact that you are Dean Winchester in any\ntimeline, and I am Castiel, and I think you are... wonderful, Dean.”\nDean can’t fucking breathe. Nobody has ever... god. God. \n“I don’t understand,” Dean says. His voice is broken. \n“I know,” Cas tells him quietly. It has started to snow beyond the curtains they didn’t close\nbefore bed, and the streetlight shadows shift here in their room. “You never do.”\n \n*\nHe doesn’t fall back asleep.\nHe curls up on his side beneath the blanket and watches Cas, stretched out on his own bed\njust a foot away, and thinks about saying his name again.\n\nChapter 3\nChapter Summary\n“We’re... you two are friends, right?” He feels himself flush even darker at the question,\nand prays it can be blamed on the alcohol in his system. “You and your Dean.”\nCas’s eyes soften. “Of course,” he murmurs.\nDean nods. “Best friends?\nChapter Notes\nSee the end of the chapter for notes\nBobby calls with a case while Dean’s eating breakfast. \n“You up for a hunt?” Dean asks around a mouthful of scrambled eggs, hanging up his phone\nand glancing across the table. “Salt-and-burn in South Dakota.”\nCas is nursing another over-sugared cup of coffee, wearing those same rumpled clothes he’s\nalways wearing. He’s got snow in his dark hair, on the width of his shoulders, melting\nquickly beneath the warmth of the diner they’re in. \n“Of course,” he says. He’s watching Dean eat intently, like it’s perfectly riveting instead of,\nas Dean has been told on many occasions, really visually unpleasant. “Can we make it by this\nevening?”\n“This afternoon, probably.” \nCas makes an agreeable sound. He’s really not big on decorum: he keeps his eyes fixed on\nDean’s face as he chews and swallows, and Dean tries not to go red. \nAt least he’s willing to go on a hunt. It’ll be nice not to be completely alone. Salt-and-burns\nare obviously old hat at this point, but still, Dean’s not stupid enough to refuse backup when\nit’s sitting right there in an ugly trenchcoat and a backwards tie. \nAssuming Cas knows his way around a shotgun. \nIt makes sense that Cas would know how to hunt monsters. He’s a fucking angel, afterall.\nDean thinks of the way Cas had given no reaction when Dean sliced his palm that first night,\nwhen he tested him with salt and holy water; those aren’t procedures that folks unused to\ndealing with the supernatural would be so accepting of. \n“Hey Cas?”\n\n“Yes, Dean?”\nDean’s not sure why this next question feels like a big one—compared to all that Cas told\nhim in the middle of the night before, compared to the strange and intrinsic and compelling\nconviction Dean woke up with to not let Cas out of his sight, it’s fuckin’ hum-drum—but it\ndoes. He watches his fork scrape through the residue of bacon grease on his plate as he\nspeaks. \n“Me and Sam, we’re still, uh. Are we still hunting in the future?”\nCas is quiet for a moment, as if considering his words. “Yes,” he says finally. “You were\nwhen I left you. You two always choose the right thing, in the end—the selfless thing. So far,\nneither of you have been presented an opportunity where you felt that your departure from\nthe world of hunting would be justifiable.”\nDean absorbs this, drinking a cup of coffee that tastes like dishwater and continuing to avoid\nCas’s gaze. Makes sense. Sam and him. Hunting for the rest of their days, saving people’s\nlives because it’s the right thing to do—and it is. Dean knows this. They were born hunters,\nand hunters don’t get to leave. Either they die on the job, or they get dragged back in\neventually. \nBecause, well. Cas was right. Half of this sour twisting anger that rises to the back of his\nthroat when he thinks of Sam running off to Stanford is really just jealousy, and the other half\nis plain ole missing him. \nIt’d be nice to know that they get a break eventually. \n“I like to think that the two of you get out after I leave,” Cas continues, and it’s almost\nwistful, that current beneath the regular burr of his voice. “Save the world as you always do,\nand then take the rest that you so deserve. Pass the mantle down to someone else.” \nDean lets himself smile at Cas across the sticky tabletop, though maybe he shouldn’t have.\nHe’s sure it’s grim. “Hunters don’t get out,” he says, echoing his own thoughts. Echoing the\nwords John Winchester had said to him and Sam a thousand times, whenever they’d talk\nabout growing up to be firefighters or doctors or lawyers or cowboys. Dean had learned\nquickly to stop talking about doing anything but hunting until a monster put him in his grave;\nSammy never had. “Was stupid of me to ask.”\n“It’s never stupid to be hopeful, Dean,” Cas says, in that solemn-soft way of his. \nLast night he had healed Dean. He had set his hands on him, warm and the opposite of\nharmful, and the light that he had poured down through Dean’s skin was his soul. It is\noverwhelming, how good he is; it gets caught in the back of Dean’s throat all over again. \n“Naive, then,” Dean says. He doesn’t know why he’s arguing. Something beyond his\nbreastbone fizzles, a spark looking for a wick to ignite. Sometimes it’s better to burst into\nflames, if only to burn away the evidence. He knows exactly why he’s arguing. “I’m gonna\ndie hunting, Cas. I’ve always known that.”\n\n“Dean—”\n“Anyway,” Dean interrupts, bulldozing over whatever lovely thing Cas was going to say to\nhim. Cutting it off like chaff from wheat. Grinding it to dust beneath his heel. “So, you ever\nhunt with us? Know how to gank a ghost?”\nIt was a hamfisted transition—and a desperate one at that. There’s something not quite like\npity in Cas’s face, something close enough to make Dean’s jaw hurt. \n“I have,” Cas says. He is letting Dean get away with this in every way but one: his knees\npress against Dean’s beneath the table, and Dean grips his fork too tight. “I do. I won’t be a\nburden on this hunt.”\nThat hadn’t been at all what Dean was worried about, and realizing it puts that hot tightness\nback in his throat, because it should have been. Stupid, says John. Stupid, thinks Dean. \n“Good,” Dean says, meaning it, because this way it’s a good idea to bring Cas along now,\ninstead of making Dean act like a little kid, thinking up any desperate silly reason not to be\nleft alone. “Right. Good. Let’s get a move on.”\nWhen they leave, Cas walks close enough to Dean that his coat licks Dean’s shins. \n \n*\n \nWhen Dean Winchester was seven years old John left him alone with his gun. \nRecalling the memory now is like watching some other family through a fogged-up window,\nsome other father and little boy, some baby other than Sammy sleeping in the motel bed on\nhis back atop a soft pale blanket. John had smelled like whiskey, but his hands hadn’t shook\nwith it yet; his face had been unshaven and rough, but he still slipped Dean smiles like secret\ngifts; later in the evening John would go, head out into the muggy Mississippi evening and\nleave Dean with explicit instructions on how to take care of the baby and how to heat up a\nfrozen dinner in the microwave, but for that moment, he was still there. \n“Like this,” John said, kneeling next to Dean on the scrubby tan carpet. His big hands moved\nmethodically, flipping the safety back and forth, back and forth, and to Dean the tangle of\nfingers and metal was a blur. “Got it?”\n“Yessir,” Dean said, which was not true. He already knew that the right thing to say was\nwhatever John wanted to hear, whether it was true or not. \n“Good job,” John said gruffly. He’d cuffed Dean on the shoulder, hard and affectionate. “You\nkeep this thing on you while I’m gone, you hear? Nobody’s gonna try to get in here, but if\nthey do, you shoot ‘em. Don’t hesitate. Just like I showed you, yeah, son? Gotta keep Sam\nsafe.”\n\n“Yeah,” Dean had said. Dad left them at night sometimes, but he’d never had Dean use his\ngun before, and it was thrilling for a moment, an excited, righteous sort of thrum, to be\ntrusted with something like this.\nThe excitement had faded the moment the Impala’s engine roar faded from Dean’s ears,\nsmelted itself down into a hard cold lump of fear. \nWhat was different about this place that Dean needed a gun to keep him and Sammy safe?\nWhat was so terrible beyond the thin door of the motel that Dad didn’t even want Dean to set\nthe gun aside to eat?\nDean hadn’t slept that night. He’d sat on the edge of the bed over Sam’s soft little body until\nJohn got back, one eye on the rise and fall of Sam’s chest and the other on the door. \nHeart in his throat, hand on the trigger. \n \n*\n \nDean fucking hates digging graves. \nThis one, specifically, is a real son of a bitch. The South Dakota dirt in January is harder than\ndiamonds—they may as well be trying to shovel their way through a shelf of stone, with the\nway this is going—and Dean’s got sweat gathering frigid on his lower back, on the nape of\nhis neck, in his armpits. \nIt’s another moonless night, too. Black as pitch. The cloud cover makes the sky seem low and\nclose, like the lid of a pot, pushing Dean down into the grave as fast as he can dig it, and he\ncan’t see shit even with the flashlight Cas swings Dean’s way haphazardly from time to time. \nSpeaking of Cas. \n“Can’t you get this done faster?” Dean pants. They’re maybe three feet down, and there’s\ngravedirt clinging like tar to the lines of Dean’s palms. “Use a little angel mojo?”\nIn all fairness, Cas is the main reason they’ve managed to get this far at all: he’s really\nfucking strong—whether for angel reasons or because, as Dean is starting to suspect, he’s\nactually pretty jacked beneath that trenchcoat—and the rock-hard earth is giving him about as\nmuch trouble as sand would. Cas ain’t sweating his balls off. \nHe shovels dirt methodically, a calm, focused expression on his face. He really knows how to\nuse those shoulders. \nDean turns his gaze away. \n“And what do you mean by that, exactly?” Cas asks, and Christ, he’s not even a little short of\nbreath. Dean, who is panting like a fucking racehorse, tries to muffle a couple of his worst\n\ngasps into the collar of his jacket. “Am I not being helpful enough?”\n“No need to get bitchy,” Dean mutters. “Couldn’t you just... I dunno, blast a hole in the\nground?”\nCas doesn’t answer for a couple seconds, and the sound of his shovel beating rhythmically\nagainst the dirt has stopped. Dean looks up again, scowling protest ready on his lips, but it\nfades away at the look Cas is giving him: arch and amused, with enough fondness gentling\nthe edges that Dean doesn’t feel like he’s being made fun of. \nIt’s... nice, in a way. Cas looking at Dean like he’s done something endearing. Like Dean is a\nthing he wants to look at. \n“What?” he says, making his expression as affronted as possible. It hits him that they must be\nstanding real close together, in order to see each other’s faces like this. He hopes he doesn’t\nhave dirt all fucking over his. \n“That certainly wouldn’t attract any attention during our clandestine grave robbery, would\nit?” Cas says wryly. “A blast of light shooting into the earth? Although if you’re tiring, you\nare welcome to take a break while I finish up.”\nThe thing is that Cas is kind of a dick, but he’s also also maybe the sweetest guy Dean’s ever\nmet.\n“I’m,” says Dean, “no, I’m. Whatever.”\nHe slams his shovel into the ground as hard as it’ll go, ignoring Cas’s soft chuckle. \nThey work in relative silence for a while longer, back-to-back in the pit. \nIt had been fairly easy to figure out where their ghost’s body was buried. Just a scan of who’d\nbeen laid to rest in this little town cemetery in the last two hundred years, and the cause of all\nthe activity locals had been reported was quickly narrowed down: Quincy Harrison, 1913-\n1952, killed by his brother and stuck in the ground a few feet away from the family plot after\nthat same brother married his surviving wife. Dean gets why the guy’s pissed, although it’d\nbe nice if he wouldn’t blame his brother’s grandkid who recently moved back to town. It’s his\ngreat nephew, after all. And... kinda his great stepkid?\nOk, fine, Dean gets it. \nStill, they can’t let Harrison hang around running people’s cars off the road. \nIt’s been a bit since Dean’s done the research for a case—Sam, clearly the smarter of the two\nof ‘em, had a head for that sort of thing and had ever since he was a kid, and then after he left\nJohn had mostly picked cases for him and Dean that didn’t need much more research than\nwhat was written in his journal—but he doesn’t have Sammy’s steel-trap brain to memorize\nobscure facts for him now, and doesn’t have Dad’s journal to flip through for helpful hints.\nJust him, and Cas, and the ramshackle handful of charm possessed between the two of them. \n\nDean had pretended to be annoyed back there in the library when Cas just sat to the side and\nwatched him work, but he’s got a sneaking suspicion he didn’t pull it off. It’s difficult to stay\npissed when you’ve got the full force of that earnest blue gaze turned your way. \nPlus, halfway through, Cas had run to the gas station across the street and bought Dean a\nsandwich and a coffee. He’d sat at Dean’s side, turned sideways, his broad shoulders\nblocking Dean from the librarian’s view. He’d handed Dean the first half of the sandwich and\nthen, when he’d finished it, the second, as if it was a task of equal importance to anything\nelse he could be doing with his time. \nThey’d shared the coffee. Cas had sipped it with a smile when Dean offered, even though it\nwasn’t fucked up on sugar the way he liked, and the fact that Dean’s still thinking of that\nsmile now, up to his head in a grave, says enough. \n“Go do something useful,” Dean had muttered. \n“Ensuring that you have enough nutrition in your system to remain healthy is the most useful\njob for me at this moment in time,” Cas had said in a library-whisper. \nHe just opens his mouth and says the craziest shit. \nHalf an hour later and Dean hears Cas’s shovel hit wood, a fibrous hollow thunk. He meets\nDean’s eyes across the dirt and nods once, sharp, before tugging himself out of the hole and\nextending a hand down Dean’s way. \nDean takes it. Cas’s palm is dry, slightly rough, very warm; he pulls Dean up and out of the\ngrave like it’s nothing, untold strength in the line of his arms. \nJesus. He could probably pick Dean up if he wanted to. Ain’t that a fuckin’ thought. \n“Thanks,” Dean says, quiet here among the clustered headstones. He takes a second to catch\nhis breath as he digs in his pockets for a lighter, watching Cas pour a slow circle of kerosene\ndown into the freshly-turned earth. Watching him move there in the dark. \nHe has a split second to register Harrison’s ghost showing up in the corner of his vision\nbefore he is being picked up and hurled into a tree.\n“Come on, ” Dean groans. The back of his skull smarts like fucking crazy, and there’s a\nhollow sort of ringing sound low in his ears that can’t be good: before his eyes Harrison\nflickers, snarling low, and he looks horrible with half his own head permanently bashed in, so\nDean’s not that bent outta shape when his vision goes wonky and suddenly there are two out-\nof-focus ghosts all up in his grill. \nThe lighter had fallen out of his hand as Harrison threw him. If he cranes his neck he can see\nit a few feet away, glimmering there in the dark, and if he can just reach it he might have a\nchance of tossing it into Harrison’s grave before the guy decides to pick him up and brain\nhim on another tree.\n\nHe hurls himself to the side, half his body passing through Harrison as he does it: it’s a\nhorrible kind of cold, one with a presence, one that clings to him as he army crawls the last\nfoot or so to the lighter and finally grasps it. Goddamn ghosts, he thinks, struggling to his feet\nas his vision swims. Always so combative—\nHarrison picks him up again, jerking him wildly like he’s a puppeteer and Dean’s a\nmarionette he doesn’t particularly like, and Dean says “You are an inconvenient piece of\nshit,” as meanly as he can when his air passage is being closed off by fucking spectral energy\nor whatever, and then there is a bang and Harrison disappears. \nDean falls to the earth hard, right on his ass, knocking his elbow on a tombstone on the way\ndown. It jostless the breath out of his lungs. He looks up. \nCas stands a few feet away, shotgun still raised and aimed at the patch of air where Harrison\nhad been. \nYou’d think Dean had just been ripped in half with the way Cas is looking at him, all wide\nworried eyes and the frown across his forehead and the way he almost steps in Dean’s\ndirection but doesn’t quite. Just sways a little. \nDean tosses him the lighter, tongue feeling heavy in his mouth. Cas catches it one-handed,\neasy, and lights up the grave without looking. \n“That went pretty well,” Dean says as Cas comes closer to him. He’s still a little lightheaded\nbut it’s fading fast; probably not a concussion, then. Although he’s certainly got a helluva\nbump rising back there. “All things considered.” \n“Are you alright?” \n“Peachy.” \nCas has lowered the shotgun but he’s still holding it, almost careless. The fire lights him up\ngolden from behind, and standing above Dean who is still splayed upon the ground, he looks\nglorious and untouchable. He raises an eyebrow at Dean, that gesture that Dean’s come to\nunderstand means that Cas is absolutely not going to take any shit. It always makes Dean’s\nthroat sorta dry. \nToday is no exception. \n“Come along,” Cas says. He doesn’t bother waiting for Dean to comply, though Dean had\nbeen scrambling to do so anyway; he stoops slightly and gets one of those broad hands\naround Dean’s upper arm, hauling him to his feet and marching him across the graveyard to\nwhere Baby is parked. \nDean goes. Heart thudding, Dean gives into the command of Cas’s touch and Dean goes. \n“I should drive,” Cas says, opening Baby’s trunk like he’s done it a thousand times and\nstowing the shotgun quickly. He still hasn’t let go of Dean. “You were quite loud, and now\n\nsomething is on fire, and I don’t think we should risk you being too dazed to get us out of\nhere quickly.”\nDean makes himself tug his arm away. “I’m fine,” he says, a bit more bite to it than he’d\nmeant to use. He doesn’t need to be coddled, and the implication that Cas thinks he does\nmakes him feel dull and young and stupid again. At the same time, he likes the feel of Cas’s\nhands on him, and he likes the gentle, unyielding way Cas takes charge. Likes it too much. \nCas shoots him another look, and it’s worried, but it isn’t pitying. He also has not scolded\nDean for letting his attention slip, or even appeared to be angry about it. He just seems to care\nabout Dean’s wellbeing, and that’s it. \nSomething deep inside Dean softens, like ice cream in the sun. \n“Dammit, Cas,” Dean grunts, handing over Baby’s keys. Their knuckles brush. “If you crash\nher I am kicking your ass so fast you won’t see what’s coming.”\n“Your faith in me is astounding,” Cas says dryly, but the corner of his mouth twitches, even\nas Dean stomps around to the passenger seat and slides in. \nAnd Dean would never admit this in a thousand years—not to Cas, not to Sammy, not even to\na perfect stranger and barely to himself—but god, it’s such a relief to be able to sit back after\na rough hunt and trust that somebody else is gonna get them to a safe place. Because he does\ntrust Cas, he realizes: he’s only known the guy a couple days, but already be’s been\nunselfishly kinder to Dean than almost anybody Dean can think of, and probably saved his\nfucking life at least twice. He has asked Dean for nothing, and in return he’s given him\ncompanionship, and someone to listen to him whine, and an anchor point to wake up to when\nthe nightmares get too bad. He has helped Dean for no reward, and healed him, and said the\nmost wonderful, unbelievable things that have ever been said about Dean in his life. \nMaybe that’s why, instead of sitting there tense and rigid and on-edge like he is any time he\nlets Sam drive Baby, Dean lets himself relax back into the cradle of her leather seats and\nwatches Cas calmly. \nHe looks good behind the wheel. Hands properly at ten and two, shoulders relaxed, eyes on\nthe road, handsome even with that smudge of dirt along his strong jaw. He looks like\nsomebody that would drive you for miles and miles, just to keep you safe. \nCas was right. Dean’s faith in him is astounding. \n \n*\n \n“I’m going out for a little while,” Dean says later, after he’s taken a good long shower and\nwashed the dirt from his hands and the smell of gas from his skin. “You wanna come?”\n\nCas is stretched out on his bed in the motel they’re in tonight, ankles crossed, watching some\nlate night talk show host with a rapt, if slightly horrified, expression. He slides his eyes over\nto Dean at this, though he doesn’t turn his head. \n“Out,” Cas repeats. “You mean, to a bar?”\nDean shrugs. He feels restless, jittery, blood active in his veins the way it always gets after he\nwraps up a hunt. He needs to—do something. Flirt with somebody, swindle a couple tens off\nsomebody else, drink until he can sit still without feeling like he’s gonna peel out of his skin. \n“Guess so,” he says. \n“And I won’t be, ah.” Cas hesitates. “‘Getting in your way?’’ \nJesus, he uses air quotes. Where the hell did this guy come from?\n“You’ll be alright, man,” Dean says, and lets his smile loose, the slow, easy one, as he slides\nhis jacket back on. He finds that it’s true. He doesn’t have any plans to actually go home with\na girl tonight; just satisfy this itch that dances beneath his skin, this urge to be appreciated by\nsomebody willing and warm. “Don’t worry ‘bout it.”\n“Alright, Dean,” Cas says, and smiles back at him from across the room. He rolls smoothly to\nhis feet and the TV turns off with a flick of his wrist. \n“Show off,” Dean mutters. Cas laughs as he moves by him, an admittance that’s somehow\nutterly shameless, and touches Dean’s elbow seemingly just because he wants to. \nThe bar is just across the street from their motel, a fall-down place with a couple people\nminding their business as they smoke out front and a neon sign missing half its letters. Inside,\nit smells like spilled beer and fried food and familiarity, and Dean wades in easily with Cas at\nhis side. \nThey sit at the bartop towards the back, with an equally good view of the entrance and the\nrest of the patrons. It’s a force of habit for Dean, who has probably hasn’t entered a room\nwithout thoroughly casing it since he was four years old. As for Cas, well. He seems content\njust to follow Dean, as long as Dean isn’t walking into trouble.\nHe orders them both a beer, resolving to take care of Cas’s for him if it turns out angels don’t\ndrink alcohol, either. Cas watches him do it with his elbows propped up, his hands clasped\nloosely in front of him. When Dean glances to him as the bartender walks away, Cas smiles.\n“Thank you, Dean,” he says. \n“Just a beer, dude,” Dean says. Cas’s knee is pressed to his between their stools,\nundemanding and tangible and firm. Dean doesn’t pull away. \nTurns out angels can drink, but Cas doesn’t really enjoy the taste so Dean just keeps doing it\nfor him. When he’s done with his own bottle he swaps it for Cas’s full one and Cas doesn’t\nsay anything, just wraps his hands around Dean’s empty and continues to sit comfortably\nnext to him. \n\nHe’s a pretty good drinking buddy, for someone who isn’t actually drinking. He follows\nDean’s threads of conversation with genuine interest, even though they get increasingly less\neasy to string together as Dean switches them to whiskey and gets increasingly tipsy, and by\nthe time Dean’s pleasantly buzzed Cas has him laughing, his cheeks flushed and his insides\nwarm as gold. \n“Do you guys ever do this?” Dean asks him. “Hang out?”\nHe’s gone from letting Cas’s leg touch his at the beginning of the night to actively leaning\nagainst it now, and when he turns to catch Cas’s eye it presses them firmly together from\nthigh-to-thigh. Dean’s heart is beating fast for absolutely no reason. \nCas doesn’t have to ask Dean who he means. He drums his fingers softly against the empty\nglass held in his loose grip, looking at Dean close. “When there’s time,” he answers. “We\ncertainly enjoy each other’s company, though we aren’t always in a position to capitalize\nupon it. We make do.”\nIt isn’t the answer Dean’s looking for, though he’s not sure exactly what he wants to hear. He\ntakes a long drink, considering his next question carefully. \n“We’re... you two are friends, right?” He feels himself flush even darker at the question, and\nprays it can be blamed on the alcohol in his system. “You and your Dean.”\nCas’s eyes soften. “Of course,” he murmurs.\nDean nods. “Best friends?\nHe wants to take it back as soon as he asks it, embarrassment sparking all along his skin. It’s\nlike he’s in middle school again, passing a note over to his crush: do you like me? Circle yes\nor no. \nOnly—well, it obviously isn’t like that. Obviously not at all. \nBut Cas says, “Yes, Dean,” and he sounds so damn sure. Like he wants Dean to be sure. “You\nare the best friend I have ever had.”\nHe said something like that last night. You are the best and most loving person I have ever\nknown. \nIt would be easy to believe Cas is just blowing smoke up his ass if it weren’t for how\ngoddamn earnestly he says everything. Every word out of his mouth would be a confession if\nDean said them, but to Cas they are simply facts of life. The sky is blue and the grass is green\nand Cas thinks Dean Winchester is the best man he has ever met. \nDean doesn’t know what to do with it. All this praise heaped upon him. All this brilliance\ncreating a standard to hold himself to. \nHe wants Cas to see him for the piece of shit he is, just so he isn’t disappointed later down\nthe line. He wants Cas to think he’s wonderful for the rest of time. \n\nSuddenly the bar is stifling, and the pleasant babble of conversation that’s been around them\nall evening is so loud that Dean can’t think. Cas is gonna find out. Shit, it’s a miracle that he\nhasn’t yet, in either timeline of knowing Dean. Something is gonna flay back the hard cold\nlayer Dean keeps pulled up over himself at all times and Cas will look in, see all Dean’s\nrotten parts, see the nastiness that has a permanent home beneath his skin, and he’ll know\nwho Dean really is. What he really is. How unworthy he is to his very core. \n“Dean?” Cas looks concerned again, for the thousandth time in the handful of days Dean has\nknown him, and just like every other instance, it’s Dean’s fault. He touches Dean’s thigh an\ninch or so above the knee, just a light thing, but Dean feels it zip through to his core. \nSelfish, says John. \n“Bathroom,” says Dean, slipping off his stool. Cas’s hand falls away; Dean wobbles,\nunsteady; Cas’s hand lifts again and then there it is, warm and large and gentle in the dip of\nDean’s waist, and Dean’s pulse is going to give one good shiver and explode right out of him.\n“I gotta...”\nCas is so close like this. If Dean wanted to (Dean wants) he could sit back down and let Cas\nlean up against him again, bone aligned if with bone, and if Dean wanted to (god, he’s so\nselfish, he takes things and he marks them with his hands just so they’ll belong to him) he\ncould forgo that and tip forward into the pocket of warmth that Castiel make wherever he\ngoes, his hand on Dean’s waist, Dean’s face tucked into the curve of his neck. \n“Be right back,” Dean gets out, pulling away from Cas’s steadying touch. He makes his way\nto the bathroom blindly, locking himself into the first open stall he finds and sinking his head\ndown into his hands. \nThere’s nobody else in here. The door slams closed, muffling the chatter on the other side,\nand all Dean can hear now is the slow drip of the faucet, the breath in his throat, the blood in\nhis ears. \nThis has always been the problem. This—the wanting. Wanting things that he isn’t supposed\nto want, that he isn’t allowed to want. A night of sleep in a warm bed and the knowledge that\nhis little brother is happy and protected, safe from the things they killed and the father who\ntaught them how; that same brother to be happy when he sees him, instead of looking at Dean\nand seeing only the life he’d do anything to escape; a future that looks like something other\nthan a bloody end; a boy’s mouth on his, gentle eyes and hands steady even if Dean’s shake. \nHe kicks the leg of the stall hard, and it aches up through his foot. Not enough pain to ground\nhim completely, but enough that he’s able to struggle through a full inhale. Pain is good. Pain\nis something to focus on, something that is common enough in his day-to-day that he can use\nit to chart his way through life like points on a map. \nSelfish, selfish, selfish. If Dad could see him now he’d kick Dean out all over again. \nBut Dad can’t see him, because Dean’s too much of a disappointment to keep around. \n\n“Shit,” Dean mutters into the butt of his palms. His air supply is nothing but a tight tangled\nhandful at the base of his throat, and he’s a little bit drunk already which is just making\neverything worse. More dramatic. He’s being—fucking dramatic. Who cares what he wants?\nWhat goddamn difference does it make if he wants something so bad that he feels it like a\nphysical pain in the tender core of him? He’s a hunter—he’s a man. He is supposed to shove\nwant like this down. \nSo he does. \nLeaning against a dirty bathroom stall Dean breathes in, and out, and he wraps up all this\ndesire that’s trembling through him on unsteady legs as small as it will go. He shoves it\ndown. Down. Away. \nHe doesn’t know how long it’s been when he leaves the stall. He glances at himself in the\ncracked mirror as he splashes some water on his face—he’s pale as a ghost, his jaw set like\nstone, expression dark enough that he has to look away—and then he dries his hands on his\nshirt and leaves the bathroom, bracing himself for Cas’s... for Cas. \nDean can see him there at the bar. He still looks worried, and he hasn’t ordered anything else;\neven from this distance, Dean can see how tense he is. His shoulders and the line of his neck\nare rigid enough that he looks physically uncomfortable, and that’s all Dean’s fault, too. Dean\nshouldn’t’ve run like that—\nHe slams into somebody hard, letting out a grunt of air. \n“Fuck,” Dean says, hands coming up automatically to steady them. “Shit, sorry...”\nShe’s small, soft under his hands. She’s scowling when their eyes meet but it turns into a look\nof surprise and then a small, sly grin the longer Dean stares. \n“Watch yourself, handsome,” she says, low. \nThe itch is still there in his blood. The thirst. And she’s warm, and she’s smiling at him, and\nthe ends of her hair air soft when they graze the backs of his hands. \n“Rather watch you,” Dean says, deep and honey-slow. \nHis voice is a little too rough for just running into a pretty stranger, a little torn up from\nsomething else that’s very obviously not her, but she doesn’t seem to mind. She laughs, the\nkinda laugh somebody gives when they’re willing to act like everything’s amusing if it’ll get\nthem a good time, and something drops out of Dean with relief. \nIt’s so much easier when they don’t expect anything out of him but that he’ll make them feel\ngood. \n“That line usually work?” she asks. She’s got big round eyes and a raspy tone, like she\nsmoked a pack before strolling in here. Her hands are small on his chest. \n“Does it matter?” Dean asks, and her hands are small but they’ve still got power when she\npushes him back into the corner by the jukebox. \n\nThey talk a bit more, but not much. They each know what they want, and Dean likes that she\ndon’t try too hard to sugarcoat it. Her name’s Candace, and she likes touching his chest and\nhis shoulders and his arms, and he doesn’t have trouble letting her kiss him. \nAnd it does feel good to be touched like this. Soft and close, a little rough when she puts him\nwhere she wants him with a hand on the back of his neck. It’s nice when she makes a little\nsweet moan against his mouth when he parts his lips, it’s nice that she clearly loves the way\nhis hands span her hips and stroke easily up her spine. It’s nice to feel wanted. It’s nice to\nmake someone feel good. \nThere’s no aching heat in his gut. No consuming want that leaves him hot and breathless and\nshaky. \nHe doesn’t mean to do it, but he does. She draws back for a sip of air and Dean opens his\neyes, and they stay open as she moves back in, and then—\nHe meets Cas’s gaze. \nCas is watching. Unabashedly. Closely. Candace squeezes the back of Dean’s neck and bites\na little at his lip, and Cas’s hand goes tight in his lap even from all the way across the room,\nCas’s eyes are so fucking dark, his lips are parted so slightly and he’s just watching, watching\nDean kiss her, watching her kiss him, and suddenly that aching wanting tumultuous heat\npunches through Dean so fast that he whimpers.\nCas swallows. It moves down his throat, visible in the low light that limns him. \nDean’s hands are shaking. She is mouthing along his jaw and Cas is shifting in his seat, and\nshe says, “Wanna get outta here, baby?” soft in the dip of his throat. \nHe’s hard. He never—he doesn’t get hard from just that with a girl, just kissing her, not\nwithout something seriously different playing in his mind to keep him in the moment. He\nfeels like a fucking newborn kitten, weak-limbed, pinned into place against this wall with\nCas’s gaze alone. \n“‘M sorry, Candace,” Dean says. He pulls out of her hold, and he knows she huffs at him,\nrightfully annoyed, but he still can’t look at her. Can’t look away from Cas. “I’m a piece of\nshit, god, sorry.”\nShe laughs, harsh. “You fuckin’ are,” she says. “Jesus Christ. Good kisser—not that that\nmeans shit from me, apparently.” \n“So are you,” Dean says, “A good kisser. Sorry. Sorry.”\nHe ducks back into the bathroom, ripping his eyes away from Cas’s at the last possible\nsecond. \nCas had licked his bottom lip as he’d watched, his eyes so fucking vivid, fever-blue, and he’d\ngripped his thighs like it was Dean he was holding onto—\n\nDean comes hard, locked into that same stall, moans bitten quiet into his forearm as he spills\ninto his hand. \nAfter, he feels as dirty as the walls around him. \nChapter End Notes\nand so henceforth the posting schedule is abolished because the author is no longer\nlaboring until the constraints of finals week thank fucking christ\n\nChapter 4\nChapter Summary\n“The first time you will remember seeing me is in a barn in Illinois,” Cas murmurs.\n“You’ll sink your blade into my chest, because you don’t know what I am and you don’t\nknow that I would do anything not to hurt you. It won’t harm me. It will make me—I\nwill want to know you.” Cas breathes in, and out. “More destructively than I’ve wanted\nanything before.”\nChapter Notes\nwe're gettin good use of that slowburn tag HOWEVER there's some nsfw business in the\nmiddle of this chapter so. eyes sharp folks\nSee the end of the chapter for more notes\nThey take a hunt in the western part of the state, and then two in Wyoming, and then one in a\nlittle town on the edge of Idaho and Oregon, and then Dean looks up one day and three weeks\nhave passed. \nHe hasn’t heard from Dad since that day back in Minnesota. He hasn’t heard from Sammy in\na thousand times that long.\nCas is still as good to travel with as he’s ever been. Lets Dean take the reins, but still keeps\nhim pretty solidly out of trouble. Don’t complain when the motels are dirty and the food is\nbad. Listens to whatever music Dean plays, and sometimes even sings along. \nDean dreams of the empty room sometimes. The gutting loss of him. \nWhen he wakes up Cas is there, watching Dean closely in the darkness. \nLife goes on. \nIt’s a Sunday, and this sleepy little town—down one werewolf, thanks to Dean and Cas, not\nthat any of its residents will ever know that—is pretty much barren as Dean eases Baby down\nthe main drag. Dean figures most everybody’s in church; it seems like that kinda place. \nHe imagines their faces if they knew he had an angel in the front seat next to him—one that\ncan shoot a gun and heal wounds and decapitate a werewolf with a strong clean sweep. He\n\nwonders if Cas can hear their prayers, or if that’s the kind of thing only the big guy upstairs is\nprivy to.\n“What are you smiling at?” Cas asks him. \n“Nothing,” Dean says, and laughs. It’s a bright day, winter-bleached, spilling sun all in\nthrough Baby’s windshield and lighting Cas up. “Nothing at all, Cas.”\nCas gives him that look—that silly human look, fond and exasperated. Dean keeps driving. \nThey don’t really have a destination in mind right. Dean’s sure that if he called Bobby the old\nman could send him halfway across the country chasing after something, but shit. Dean’s\ntired . And maybe angels really don’t sleep, as Cas claims, but the guy’s got weary lines dug\ninto the corners of his mouth that Dean would love to soothe away. Just because Cas got sent\nback into time for some eternal punishment—the details of which he still refuses to disclose\nto Dean—doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve rest. \nPlus it’s Dean’s birthday in a couple days. Sue him. \nHe points the Impala’s nose toward the coast with the vague feeling that he’s doing\nsomething he shouldn’t be, and Cas doesn’t ask him why.\n \n*\n \nIt starts to rain in the late afternoon, heavy as sheet metal. \nDean sits forward in his seat, turning the music down as he squints out into the darkness. It’s\nreally coming down out there: it beats out a roar on the metal hood of the Impala, lashing at\nher windows until he can’t see a damn thing beyond the place where her headlights get\nswallowed by the rain. \nHe feels Cas turn to look at him, lowering the paperback he’d been reading. It’s one of the\nbooks Dean has squirrelled away in Baby’s trunk beneath the guns and the salt and the holy\nwater, though Dean’s not sure which one; Cas slips a finger in to mark his place, and Dean\nforces his eyes back into the road before he crashes and kills them both. \nDean crawls along the highway for a little while longer, Bruce Springsteen trickling through\nBaby’s speakers beneath the thunder’s growl. There’s water standing on the road now,\nfrothing at Baby’s wheels, and pine trees loom like dark watchers on either side. \nHe has to pull over finally, as far to the side of the road as he can get, and wait it out a bit.\nThe wind howls like someone sobbing. Dean turns his hazards on. \nCas doesn’t ask what he’s doing. He just turns to face Dean in his seat as if he knows they’ll\nbe here for a while, inviting Dean in with the angle of his shoulders. \n\n“Good thing we ain’t in a hurry,” Dean mutters. He tips his head back against the window\nand peers up at the sky, gray as wet pavement between the tree boughs. Watching the rain\ncome down from this angle makes him dizzy, in a gentle, rocking kinda way. The glass is\ncool against his cheek. \n“Where are we headed to?” Cas finally asks—not like he’s on Dean’s ass about meandering\nthis way, skipping across the country as if there’s nothing in the wide world to be afraid of.\nJust like he’s vaguely curious. \nDean makes himself stay leaning back, staring up. “Thought we could go to the coast,\nmaybe,” he says, unsure why the words trip themselves in his throat. As usual, he sounds too\ngruff. “Thought we deserved a day off. I dunno.”\nCas is silent for too long, and Dean breaks his own rule and looks at him. \nHe’s smiling. The small one. The one that Dean wants to hold in the cup of his hand. \nDean thinks Cas knows. \n“We do,” Cas agrees. The hand that isn’t clutching the book—and oh, god, it’s Mary’s copy\nof On the Road, creased and bent up, one of the only things of his mother’s that Dean owns,\nand there is so much behind the fact that Dean’s first instinct isn’t to make Cas put it back\nwhere he found it—the hand that’s resting palm-down on the seat slides over to Dean’s knee.\nTouches it briefly, just fingertips. “Especially you.”\nDean scoffs. Tries to look offended. Doesn’t let his leg fall to the side, into Cas’s hand, into\nhis open touch. “I’m not the one who just time traveled, though,” he says. \nCas cocks an eyebrow at him. “Dean, I am an all-powerful cosmic entity the likes of which\nyou will not be able to truly understand for many years yet to come. I am not ‘wiped out’ by\nmere time travel.”\n“Yeah, alright, tough guy,” says Dean, another laugh spilling out of him, and the heater is\nfogging up the windows and the wind is swaying Baby like a cradle, and he’s tired. He’s\ntired. “Excuse the fuck outta me.”\n“Dean,” says Cas, just looking at him, just smiling. Sometimes his face goes so helpless\nwhen he looks Dean’s way, folded into a smile that he’s powerless against. Dean’s powerless\nagainst it, too. \nDean turns a little more sideways. Leans his shoulders against the door and eases a leg up\nonto the bench seat, knee bent, the other still dangling in the footwell. “Cas,” he says. Cas is\nholding Dean’s book carefully in his big hand, so he doesn’t crease it further, and Dean’s\nheartbeat is loud, and Dean scowls at him, but he’s sure it melts into a grin. “Cas.”\nWithout warning Cas winds his palm around Dean’s ankle, pulls Dean’s leg up into his lap.\nHe leaves his hand there, warm beneath the hem of Dean’s jeans and the top of his boot. \nThere’s static in Dean’s brain. \n\n“You looked uncomfortable,” Cas murmurs. He drags his eyes over Dean’s face, skimming\nfrom his own eyes to his mouth and back up again. \nDean’s holding the edge of the seat so tightly. “Not really your call to make.”\nCas tips his head, slow. \n“Jesus,” Dean mutters, too unsteady to be the growl he wants it to be. “You fucker.”\nCas laughs. His thumb rubs over Dean’s ankle bone, an easy stroking circle. And then, like\nit’s nothing, he opens the book again, one-handed, and goes right back to reading. \nAnd Dean, he fucking—he sits there. He lets Cas do it. He gets this soft patient circle rubbed\ninto a place of him that nobody has bothered to touch before, and Cas’s lips move when he\nreads, and sometimes it’s like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull, The Boss says,\ncrooning over the rain, cut a six inch valley through the middle of my skull. \nDean lets his eyes drift closed. He still ain’t that comfortable wedged against the glass like he\nis, despite Cas’s best efforts, but... but Baby as much a home as he’s ever had, and he feels\nsafe held by her warm interior. \nHeld by the weather. Held by Cas. \n“‘What is that feeling when you’re driving away from people and they recede on the plain till\nyou see their specks dispersing?’” reads Cas, low and rough and lulling. There is an ache in\nhis voice beneath those familiar words, and Dean can’t soothe it. “‘It’s the too-huge world\nvaulting us, and it’s good-bye.’”\n \n*\n \nHe expects it when the dream comes again. \nIt’s changed slightly over the passing weeks, shifted into a different shape. The room again,\nthe loss like a fist to the gut—but something else. Something warm at the edge of the room,\ndependable, the only spot of light in all this blurred gray nothing. \nDean is standing this time. His heartbeat hurts each time it comes and the air in his lungs is a\nrattling mess, but he’s on his own two feet, not slumped bonelessly to the floor. \nThere’s an empty chair in the middle of the room. \nSomebody says his name. The warmth at the edge of the room moves, looms closer; Dean\nglances that way—\nSammy. \n\n“Dean?” he says again, a question this time, and he’s frowning in concern, and god he looks\ndifferent, he looks old , so much older than the gangly kid Dean saw walk away six months\nago, and Dean takes a step forward to get his arms around him, something, anything, and\nDean—\nDean wakes up. \n \n*\n \nDean wakes up when the rain has turned to pale heavy fog, when the storm-darkness of the\nsky has been replaced by evening. \nHe blinks the nap out of his eyes. Cas is watching him from a small distance away, and when\nhe sees Dean looking at him, he smiles.\nStill touching him. Dean’s leg is cramped and his back is cold from the window and Dean\nsays, “Can you tell me how long it’ll take before I meet you for real?”\nCas’s throat makes a quiet sound when he swallows. “This is real,” he says softly. \n“I know, Cas,” Dean says. He’s so tired. “I know. I just.”\nThe quiet stretches so long that Dean thinks Cas isn’t gonna answer, and it’s not really anger\nthat Dean feels, but it’s all he knows how to show. “Forget it,” he says, sharp, pushing his leg\noff the seat and turning around even though he’s sore all over. “Don’t know why I asked.”\nCas opens his mouth like he wants to say Dean’s name, but nothing comes out. \nDean pulls back onto the road. \n \n*\n \nWhen Dean Winchester was eighteen years old he lost his virginity to a woman who called\nherself Cherry. \nShe was much older than him, and her experience was evident even in the sway of her hips as\nshe moved in close. When she kissed Dean her mouth tasted like wax, lipstick-thick and\ncool. \nIt was Dean’s birthday. An hour before, John had handed him a six pack and the keys to his\nown motel room and told Dean to go inside and wait, to “have fun, son,” and winked at him\nin the way that always preceded Dean finding something out that he was supposed to have\n\nknown all along. Dean had sat there on that bed with his palms sweating, and he was drunk\nbefore she walked in the door. \nCherry told him he was pretty. She was nicer to him than he deserved, especially since she’d\nalready been paid, and afterward she had pretended not to notice the way he laid flat on his\nback and stared at the ceiling, eyes wide open and so dry they burned. \n“You have a good time, honey?” she had asked him, propped up at his side. Her breasts were\nsoft and dusky-brown, and he thought she was pretty too, of course he did, but he knew he\nthought it the wrong way. He felt about her the way you feel about a painting in a museum:\ndistant admiration, and no sharp tug of want to have it as your own. \n“Yeah,” he had said to her. Her hair was dark and curly and looked nice around her shoulders,\nswaying around her face. It was pity that made her smile at him. “Yeah, real good.”\nHe got up to escape to the bathroom, dizzy. He stood there for a long time in front of the\nmirror just looking at himself. \nCherry’s mouth had left color on his own, lipstick smudged bright red on the pout of his\nbottom lip and a little below his chin, and Dean knew that he should wipe it off, but Dean\ncouldn’t move. Dean was immobile there against the counter, his bare feet freezing on the\nlinoleum floor, goosebumps rising on the flesh of his arms. \nHe was supposed to feel different after this—more whole. Grown. \nDean was a haunted house, and the wind blew through his eaves. \nWhen she caught him staring he blushed dark red, but she didn’t laugh at him. She grabbed\nher purse from the other room instead, and then she sat her ass on the lip of the counter and\ndrew him close between her soft thighs, one hand on his hot cheek and the other on the slope\nof his neck. \nDean kept himself still as she dragged the lipstick crayon around the circle of his mouth. He\nturned his face where Cherry guided him, those gentle pushes of her fingers, that light tug of\nhis hair; when it got too hard to look into her sharp brown eyes he let his own close, and she\nsaid nothing. \n“There you go, honey,” she said. She slipped off the counter around the back of him, getting\nher hands around his soft waist. “Look at you. Pretty as a picture.”\nHe knew that he should hate himself as he opened his eyes and stared into a different face—a\nbetter face. A... beautiful face. \nHe didn’t. He tipped his head back against Cherry’s shoulder and watched himself pant as she\nkissed his neck, as she jerked him off there in front of the mirror, a thousand times dirtier\nthan anything he’d ever let himself want and a thousand times better than what they’d done in\nthe other room half an hour before. \n\n“You keep that,” she told him later. She pressed his hand closed around the lipstick tube,\nfingers over fingers, and all the beams holding Dean up shivered. She didn’t try to kiss him\nagain. “Happy birthday, baby.”\nHe threw it away the next day, ‘cuz lipstick ain’t something a man can carry around when he\nlives with his brother and his dad. And if his eyes and the back of his throat went sharp and\nhot while he did it, well. \nWasn’t anybody around to watch him, anyway. He made damn sure of that. \n \n*\n \nThe morning Dean turns twenty-three, he wakes up to a text from Sam. \nHappy birthday. \nThat’s it. No update on how he’s doing, no questions about Dean. Not so much as a fucking\nexclamation point. \nIt doesn’t matter to Dean. He is like a dog: desperate for any bit of positive attention,\ndrooling all over himself for a kind word. It’s embarrassing how his heart leaps when he sees\nSam’s text, the first thing on their six-month-stale thread full of Dean’s increasingly desperate\nattempts to reach out before he gained some self-respect and shut the hell up. It’s\nembarrassing how quickly he hits the call button, and it’s even worse the way he wants to\nbreak something when Sam doesn’t pick up. \nDean calls again, just to listen to Sam’s stupid fucking voicemail message, his trying-too-\nhard voice on the other end: You’ve reached Sam Winchester. I’m not available right now, but\nplease leave a message after the beep!\nDean doesn’t leave a message. He hangs up each time before the beep can sound, cutting off\nthe tail end of Sammy’s voice and starting over again. \nHe sits in bed for a long time doing this, the blankets pooled around his waist. It’s raining\nagain outside the window, drizzly and gray. He’s cold. Cas is out. \nDean ain’t gonna break down and fuckin’ cry, because Dean ain’t a fuckin’ baby. He might\ngo out and have a couple beers for breakfast if Cas doesn’t get his ass back here soon,\nthough. \nThanks man, Dean types, as if he hasn’t been calling Sam over and over for the past twenty\nminutes and being resolutely ignored. As if one strong breeze couldn’t blow him over. Hope\nyou’re kicking ass. \nMiss you, he thinks, but doesn’t say. You fucking dick.\n\nSomething’s about to give, and Dean feels the brittle bend of it when he breathes in. \nCas walking through the front door keeps the snap from splintering him at the last second.\nThere’s a takeout bag clutched in one of his hands, and one of those cardboard drink carriers\nwith two coffees nestled within in the other. He looks tired today, the bags beneath his eyes\nblue. \n“Good morning, Dean,” he says. Something about him is sad in that low-down untouchable\nway, that bruise Dean can’t see but knows he had a hand in causing. He looks at Dean like he\nmisses him, even though he’s right there. Cas smiles. “Happy birthday.”\n“Yeah,” Dean grunts. He wipes the sleep from his eyes with the back of his hands, mouth dry,\nand tosses his phone down onto the nightstand so he doesn’t fucking have to look at it\nanymore. “Where were you?”\n“Across the street,” says Cas, crossing to the end of Dean’s bed. He sits on the end, legs\nfolded up beneath himself so his goddamn shoes are on the bedspread, but it’s not like they’ll\nbe here another night so Dean lets it slide. He doesn’t really have the energy to argue,\nanyway. “I brought breakfast.”\nCas hands Dean one of the coffees, keeping the other for himself. Dean sits up a little further,\nresting back against the headboard and wrapping both hands around the warm cardboard. \nHe watches the way Cas’s hands move as he sets the plastic bag down between them and\npeels back the translucent layers, drawing something small out from within. \nIt’s one of those boxed pies from a gas station, dense and dry and full of fake fruit. Cas\npresents it to Dean with a shy sort of smile—and shit. Shit, for a second Dean thinks he might\nactually fucking cry this morning, over a shitty pastry and an absent brother and an angel\nwho tries so hard to make Dean smile. \n“Thanks, man,” Dean rasps. He doesn’t feel like eating, but he probably will go for those\nbreakfast beers if he doesn’t, so. Crappy heartfelt overly-emotional pie it is. “I didn’t figure\nyou’d, um, know. When my birthday is. Didn’t figure I’d celebrate it in the future.”\n“You don’t, really,” says Cas. His elbows rest on his knees, coffee held between them, and he\nwatches Dean eat with enough of a self-satisfied tilt to his mouth that Dean’s on the verge of\nblushing. “And of course I know when your birthday is.”\n“Alright,” Dean says. “Shit, ok.”\nCas grins. \n \n*\n \n\nHe drives the last four hours to the coast without stopping, Cas quiet at his side. \nIt’s raining again when they reach a place that Dean can pull off, the kind of drizzle that\nclings to the back of Dean’s neck and fills up his lungs when he crosses around to Baby’s\ntrunk and pulls out the cooler. There’s a thick line of fir trees between them and the beach,\nswaying like a wheat field in the gusty wind, but Dean can hear the ocean anyway. The\ndistant roar. \nCas steps around Baby’s side. Glances at Dean, waiting for him to move first. \nWell, ok, then. \nThere’s a little path, picked out in a jumble of crushed shells and stone, leading from this\npacked-dirt parking area through the dense wall of trees; Dean sets off that way first,\nbreathing in the salt-fresh air. \nHe’s never been to the ocean before. He and Sam had always tried to get Dad to stop off at\none when they passed through a coastal state, especially during the summer when the air\ninside Baby stifled their skin like a weight—of course he never did it, wouldn’t have even if\nthey did have time for a luxury like that, but they’d always hoped. \nIt doesn’t feel right going somewhere sunny without Sam. Somewhere with hot golden sand\nand lifeguards in ugly red shorts and fuckin’ striped umbrellas. \nEmerging on the other side of the treeline, this slate-colored shore seems perfect. \nDean doesn’t bother going down to the water. It’s freezing, actually, the briney air sneaking\nup under his layers and sending a shock of shivers down his skin. He sticks to the border of\npines and leads Cas to the first fallen log he sees, good for sitting on and drinking and\nlooking gloomily out at the untouchable ocean. \nHe drops the cooler. Settles down onto the waterlogged wood, Cas joining him a little closer\nthan anybody else would, and grabs a beer. \nDean’s heels drag lines in the pale gray sand. It clings in granules to the hem of his jeans. \nThe ocean swells and crashes and swells again. \nAll along his left side is Cas, sitting so close that Dean is warm despite the chill rolling in off\nthe surf, and utterly heedless of the way the log they’re on is soaking moss and water up into\nhis coat. Cas breathes in deeply, his head tipped up to face the sky. His eyes are closed. It\ncould be prayer, Dean thinks, if there wasn’t that divot between his eyebrows. \n“I'll have to wipe your memory at a certain point,” he murmurs. “You do know that.”\nHe’s barely distinguishable from the crashing waves, the bullet-rattle of rain hitting the ocean\nfar out from their cover of pine boughs, and Dean wants to lean in to catch his words but he\nfeels himself draw back instead. Draw himself still. \n“Guess I hadn’t really thought about it.”\n\nCas looks at him now. It feels better to be looked at somehow, and then, at the same time,\nindescribably worse—like Cas is just slipping past Dean’s outer layer and taking a peek at\nwhat’s beneath, reading Dean so that Dean both doesn’t have to explain himself and also\ndoesn’t get the chance to. \n“I think if I—” Dean stops. Takes a long drink, like a piece of punctuation, and knows Cas\ndoesn’t miss it. He delivers the rest of his words to his knees. “I think if I gotta forget you\nanyway, I at least deserve to. To know.”\nA bird alights on the rocky beach a few yards down from them, quick and light, like a\nsmudge of white paint on the horizon. Dean drinks again. The bird is gone. \n“Does it matter?” Cas asks him. “Isn’t it enough to know just that we do meet?”\nIt hits Dean then. \nCas is afraid. \nDean’s settled by it, in a way that feels as wrong and as instinctual as sinking a bullet\nbetween something’s eyes. What use is he, if not to be strong in the face of someone else’s\nfear?\nDean nudges Cas’s foot with one of his own, leg falling to rest against leg. “‘Course it’s\nenough,” he says, too hoarse. “But I’m a selfish bastard, and I ain’t ever satisfied.”\nCas slips his leg forward, trapping his ankle beneath Dean’s. Winding them up in each other. \n“It’s a little over half a decade before we meet,” Cas tells him. \nJesus. Half a decade. Dean’ll be—what, thirty? That’s enough time to become a different\nperson in, a couple times over.\nHe wonders if this Cas will stick around all that time, wait to wipe Dean’s memory until the\nvery last second. He wonders what this Cas will do once future Cas rolls into town. Where\nhe’ll go, and who will take care of him. \nNot that he needs taking care of—he’s a fucking age-old soldier of God—but still. Still.\n“What,” says Dean, “so you meet some middle-aged guy somewhere and decide he’s the one\nyou wanna pal around with on earth?”\nCas huffs a soft laugh. “You’re hardly middle-aged when I meet you, Dean,” he says, and\ntouches the knob of Dean’s wrist where it pokes out beneath his jacket sleeve. “And it’s... it’s\ncertainly not that simple. Though, ultimately, it is you that I choose to ‘pal around with,’\nmuch to the dismay of basically every other celestial force in this universe. And a few earthly\nones, too.”\n“Jesus,” says Dean.\n“Not him.”\n\nDean smiles. “Fuck off,” he says, and lets himself slump a little further into Cas’s warmth.\n“Tell me how we meet?”\\\nCas is breathing slow and steady against Dean, rising and falling like the tide. “I’ve told you\nbefore,” he says quietly, “that heaven has a plan for you.”\nIt’s not a question, but Dean nods anyway. He finishes his beer. \nSometimes it’s hard to believe heaven has a plan for a man whose own father and brother\ndon’t even want him around, but he’s been trying. Turning the idea over and over in his head\nso the light shines through all sides. \n“I don’t want to tell you exactly how we meet,” Cas says. “I don’t want to risk heaven\ninterfering with the course of your life because of something I’ve said, even if I know—even\nif you won’t remember I told you after a while.”\n“I’ll be ok, Cas. I can take it.”\n“I know you can.” Cas’s fingers are wrapped around Dean’s wrist now, the pad of his thumb\nnestled against Dean’s pulse-point; the wind picks up the salt of the ocean and the scent of\nhim, something a little like metal and a little like the Impala and a little like the road. Dean\nwants. Fiercely Cas says, “But you shouldn’t have to.”\nThere it is again—the kinda thing that should probably make Dean mad. Affronted. The\nkinda thing that, on John Winchester’s tongue, would be a slight rather than an offer to take\nsome of this weight off Dean’s shoulders. \nBut it’s Cas. Cas, who cares about two versions of Dean so deeply that it’s almost\noverwhelming. \nCas, dipping down close to speak to Dean so that his hair brushes Dean’s temple. \n“The first time you will remember seeing me is in a barn in Illinois,” Cas murmurs. “You’ll\nsink your blade into my chest, because you don’t know what I am and you don’t know that I\nwould do anything not to hurt you. It won’t harm me. It will make me—I will want to know\nyou.” Cas breathes in, and out. “More destructively than I’ve wanted anything before.”\nDean turns on the log and tucks his face into the crook of Cas’s neck, down there in that soft\nspot between the worn fold of his collar and the hot skin of his throat. Dean closes his eyes. \nThere is a moment of hesitation. Then Cas lifts his arm and slips it around Dean, presses his\nhot palm to the middle of his lower back. \n“Sorry,” says Dean softly. “That I stab you. Figure I never apologize for that in the future.”\nCastiel presses closer to him. It doesn’t answer the question either way, but Dean, well. He\nfigures he’s forgiven. \n“I’ll know you for twelve years after that,” Cas continues, letting his cheek come to rest on\nthe top of Dean’s head. Dean’s heartbeat stutters. “And though I was born before the air you\n\nbreathe, they are the best twelve years of my very long life.” \nMine too, Dean thinks. Sure, he hasn’t lived them yet, but something in him just knows. He\nhas a feeling that Cas has saved his life more times than Dean—or maybe even Cas himself\n—has given Cas credit for. \nHe might’ve done it here, now, in this timeline. Just by showing up. \n“Yeah?” Dean says, slightly wavering. “Well I’m pretty friggin’ great, I guess.” \nCas is stroking his fingers along the line of Dean’s nape, and Cas doesn’t laugh. “Yes,” he\nsays. “You are.”\n“You are too, you know,” Dean says. “I dunno what I’m like in the future but I’m probably\nstill an idiot so I’m sure I don’t tell you that enough. Or, uh. Ever.”\nCas does laugh this time, and it’s just a puff of air on Dean’s temple. He says, gently, “You let\nme know.”\nDean doubts that’s true. He keeps his eyes closed. \nIt’s... it is unbelievably good, sitting here with Cas’s arm around him—good in a way that he\ncan’t look directly at, like the sun, like his reflection in the mirror after a hunt gone bad.\nThere’s guilt there, of course, tucked away inside of him where his guilt always lives, but it’s\ndulled. It’s muffled. \nAll its sharp edges worn off by the slow gentle sweep of Cas’s palm on Dean’s spine. \nThe thought slides in like a knife between two ribs: Cas’s careful hands and his soft mouth\nand the way he looks at Dean like there’s nothing so good on earth as him. The way he lets\nDean get closer and closer, has never once stopped him. \nDean could tip his face up. Could move that last inch closer and not be stopped—be\nwelcomed instead. \nHis heart is jangling around like a fucking loose coin in the bottom of somebody’s purse and\nCas is still breathing just as calmly as ever, still just sitting there, a rock and a buoy and the\nvery tilt of the earth that’s dislodging Dean all at once. \nWhat could have happened to Cas? What deal could he have wrought that gets him hurled\nback to this time, back to a Dean that doesn’t even know him yet? \nDean should ask. \nDean can’t ask. The words stick in his throat like cold tar.\nChapter End Notes\n\nit's sam winchester's birthday today (may 2nd) so i'd like to extend a formal apology to\nhim that he's so under-represented in this fic aldksjf i'm sorry sammy i love you\n\nChapter 5\nChapter Summary\nThere is a moment where Dean falls to his hands and knees while the blood rushes in his\nears; there is a moment where Dean thinks, I want my father, and he is as small as he has\never been.\nChapter Notes\nplease note the warning change!\nSee the end of the chapter for more notes\nA werewolf slaughters young men like hogs in Nowhere, Oklahoma. \nThe body lays killed at Dean’s feet, hunched over on its front with the knobs of its spine\npressing up through its shirt like mountain peaks. He had been easy to kill, even though the\nbodies of his victims are also in this rotting barn, chest cavities gaping and open—a clear\nsign that the guy had been feeding well. \nHe was packless, though. Abandoned by those he ran with, it seems, and left to gather the\ngruesome approximation of a community around him in order not to go insane. \nDean nudges the body with his foot. The pallid skin, the dirty clothes and unwashed hair. \nIt’s unsettling to see that even monsters can’t bear being left alone. \nDean tucks his gun away. \nMovement from the other side of the barn: Dean lifts his gaze to see Cas bending and\nscooping one of the human bodies into his arms, heedless of the blood that’s dried down to\nsomething dark and thick and clinging all over the boy’s form. Cas lets the head come to rest\non his shoulder, holds the bent knees close in the crook of his elbow, and meets Dean’s eyes. \n“We should burn them,” he says. \nDean nods. There are five of them in total, all around Sammy’s age—hell, the monster\nhimself didn’t look much older than Dean is now—and they haven’t been here long. The one\nthat Dean lifts is still warm, barely an hour dead. They could’ve saved him if Dean had just\ndriven a little faster. Just been a little smarter. \n\nThere’s snow up to Dean’s ankles outside. Their footprints track bloody through it, and it\nmelts away as the fire burns down. \n \n*\n \nIt’s late when they get back to the motel, and Dean is tired, stomach sour-sick with guilt, and\nhe tells himself that that’s why he doesn’t notice the car parked next to Baby in the lot. \nDean swings himself out of the Impala as soon as they pull up, just wanting to wash away the\nblood dug down deep in the cracks of his palms. It’s been a while since he hasn’t been good\nenough to keep actual lives from being lost, and something about Cas being here to witness\nDean’s inadequacy is making it harder to deal with—when he messed up with Dad at least\nDean knew where he stood, and what was in store for him because of that. \nWith Cas... fuck. He doesn’t think Cas is even gonna mention it. Doesn’t think Cas even\nthinks Dean has done anything wrong. \nDean’s free-falling in the empty sky, hard ground rising up to meet him. \nHe digs the motel key out of his coat pocket and listens to the sound of Cas shutting Baby’s\ndoor, his footfalls crunching through the sludge of mud and ice and cigarette butts coating the\nsidewalk. Cas hasn’t tried to talk to him on the ride home, or touch him; Dean’s not sure if\nhe’s relieved or if he wants to let Cas hold him up—\n“Dean,” says Cas sharply, a hissing whisper, and Dean freezes automatically with his hand\nhalf-raised to the door. \nThe hairs on the back of Dean’s neck lift. He turns to face Cas, shoulders gone rigid. \n“What, man?”\nCas holds up a hand and Dean falls silent. Cas is staring at the motel door with a look Dean\nonly sees when they’re in the middle of a fight: eyes slightly narrowed, laser-focused like he\ncan see straight through whatever’s in front of them and on to the other side. \n“There’s someone in there,” Cas murmurs to him, low. Dean clenches his jaw, flicks his eyes\nto the only window; still curtained. He can’t discern any movement inside. \nDean pulls his gun out of his waistband and flips the safety off, heart thumping fast. He trusts\nCas, entirely and consumingly. If the guy says there’s someone in there, there’s someone in\nthere. \n“Get behind me,” Dean says, and Cas does, solid and warm and steady. He doesn’t have a\nweapon in his hand, and he doesn’t need to. Dean’ll protect him—or his grace will. “One,\ntwo, three. ”\n\nDean kicks the door open. \nJohn Winchester sits at the foot of the bed.\nFor a moment, none of them speak. Cas has gone rigid, and the ozone scent of him flares\nbriefly stronger, an electric snap, and John’s eyebrows have furrowed, his mouth turned down\nat the corners making lines in his face like craters and a bottle in his hand, and Dean—Dean\n—\nDean can’t fucking breathe. Can’t fucking move. John is here, in the place that Dean wanted\nto come back to and be safe in, sitting on the bed that Cas was going to sit on and make sure\nDean was alright while he slept. And John is drinking. And two hours ago, Dean let a boy\ndie. \n“Who the hell is this, son?” John asks. \nHis voice is rough and the ends of his words fall off, slurred. His jaw is unshaven. His eyes\nare red. Dean should have been with him, taking care of him, making sure he didn’t get to\nthis point again. Dean should have been better. \nDean can’t unstick his clumsy tongue from the roof of his mouth, and somehow, Cas can tell.\n“My name is Castiel,” he says. His voice is sharper than Dean has ever heard it, an\nunyielding steel beneath the usual kindness with which he addresses everyone. Dean would\nshiver if it was directed toward him. “Are you John Winchester?”\nJohn doesn’t answer him. His eyes are like flint. He has a shotgun tossed over his lap,\ncareless, but Dean knows the things those hands can do with a weapon. Dean knows. \n“Dad,” Dean says, and then has to try again because it comes out sounding like nothing at all.\n“Dad. How did you—why are you here?”\nDean still hasn’t lowered his gun. Dean needs to lower his gun. Dean is frozen, every muscle\nof him, by the way John Winchester stares at Castiel with nothing but contempt in his eyes. \n“Is it a fucking crime to wanna see my son now?” John barks. “Tell me who this is, Dean.”\n“Castiel,” Dean says, “Cas, he’s. Cas is a friend.”\nHe and Cas are still standing halfway inside, the nighttime blowing in cold along their backs. \n“Oh yeah?” John says. “What kinda friend has you pointing a gun at your own goddamn\nfather?”\n“Sorry, sir,” Dean says, and clicks the safety off, and hates himself. He steps forward. Cas\nfollows him, shutting the door. “Force of habit. Learned from the best, right?”\nJohn grunts. Drinks. Doesn’t set his own gun aside. “Bobby told me you were traveling\nalone.”\n\n“I was.” Dean forces his shoulders back up from the curl they’ve fallen into, pulled forward\nto protect the soft middle bits of him. John’s boots are getting dirt and melted snow all over\nthe carpet, and for some reason the sight makes Dean’s next inhale too short. “Met Cas—”\nJohn cuts Dean off, pointing at Cas with the bottle in his hand. “Wanna hear it from him.”\nBehind Dean’s body—away from John’s eyes—Cas skims his fingertips along the dip of\nDean’s back.\nDean hates it, hates it, hates it. Wants to touch him. \n“My name is Castiel,” Cas repeats, just as measured as before. If you didn’t know him you\nwouldn’t be able to hear the barely-tethered power surging beneath those words. Dean knows\nhim. “I am an angel of the lord.”\nJohn scoffs, and it’s so loud. Things haven’t been loud for weeks, Dean realizes. He and Cas\nhaven’t once had to yell. \n“Bullshit,” says John. Dean can smell him from here, four feet away—the whiskey on his\nbreath, the sweat at the back of his collar. Been a long time since he’s ended up like this; little\nmore than six months, and that week after Sam left. Dean thought he might die then. Dean\nwatches John’s hand tighten on the gun, watches him lift it as he gets unsteadily to his feet\nand glares at Cas, and Dean wishes terribly and fervently and like the worst man in the world\nthat he had. “Get the fuck away from my son.”\n“Dad, dad, stop,” Dean says, setting a hand on John’s arm. John shakes him off and Dean\nstumbles back. “ Dad. He’s telling the truth.”\n“Bullshit,” John says again. “What are you? What do you want with us?”\n“I’m telling the truth,” Cas says. He’s calm, but Dean isn’t between Cas and John anymore so\nhe sees the way Cas’s hands are curled into fists. The white of his knuckles. “And you may\nrest assured that I want nothing with you, John Winchester.”\nIt was the wrong thing to say. Dean knows it like he knows the bruise-shape of his father’s\nhand on his skin. Dean knows it like he knows the weight of a gun. \n“So it’s him you want?” John growls. Finally he looks at Dean, and it’s an expression that\nDean’s seen him wear a hundred times. \nLoss. Loss of faith in his son, loss of respect for the man he tried so hard to mold Dean into. \nDean saw John wear it when he picked Dean up from school at thirteen and caught him\nstanding too close to the only friend Dean would make that year, a boy with a laughing smile;\nDean saw John wear it when Dean got back from his first solo hunt with anguish tearing a\nhole in his chest that hasn’t healed yet; Dean saw John wear it outside of a dive bar in\nKentucky as he boxed Dean’s ears until they bled, and the morning after his eighteenth\nbirthday when he caught Dean crying in an empty motel room, and when he forgot to flirt\nwith a girl on a hunt and when he let a man teach him how to play pool with his broad warm\n\nhands on Dean’s waist, standing close the whole time, even though Dean already knew. Dean\nalready knew. \nDean knows what happens when you lose something. You do everything in your power to get\nit back again. \n“You ain’t thinking right,” John tells Dean, voice hard. There’s no room for a fight in those\nwords. They slam into Dean as John intended them to, already working at molding him back\ninto a shape with a handle and a place for bullets to launch out of in whatever direction John\nWinchester points. “You let a monster get the better of you. Step aside.”\nGod, Dean should’ve made Cas leave that first morning. He’s so stupid. So fucking stupid,\nletting himself be lulled into thinking anybody could be safe when they’re traveling at Dean\nWinchester’s side. \nDean’s hands are shaking again, like a little goddamn kid. “I can’t do that, Dad,” he rasps. \nJohn is struck dumb as Dean moves back to stand directly in front of Cas. Dean has never\ndisobeyed him this blatantly; Dean has never put himself between his father and a bullet\nwithout some sort of armor on.\n“Dean, he can’t hurt me,” Cas murmurs, and his voice is so different when he speaks to Dean\nthat it can only make everything worse. Dean can imagine how Cas is gazing at him: those\nsoft eyes, those heavy lids, the gentle shape his mouth makes when he says Dean’s name.\n“It’s alright. You don’t have to protect me.”\n“I do,” Dean snaps, though he didn’t mean to. He wants Cas to touch him again, and he wants\nto kneel at his father’s feet and beg for forgiveness, and he wants John to lift that gun and let\nloose a bullet so Dean can take it within his chest and finally do something right and he wants\nto never see John’s face again and he wants Sam to come back and he wants and he wants\nand he wants. He is a creature made of wanting. “I do, I do have to protect you.”\nJohn yells. It is a low snarl of a noise, tearing out of a place inside him that Dean doesn’t\nunderstand, and Dean flinches so badly that he nearly drops his own gun. \n“You’re out of your damn mind, son,” John hisses. He’s has gone ruddy with rage, with\ndisappointment. John’s face is nakedly disgusted, so clearly horrified at the thing his son has\nbecome that Dean almost has to shut his own eyes. “Move aside before I make you move\naside, and let me kill whatever that is like you should’ve done.”\nJohn staggers as he moves closer to Dean, but move closer he does. His breath is arid on\nDean’s skin. \n“No,” Dean says. His throat burns. “No. You don’t get to fucking touch him.”\nJohn lifts the hand with the bottle in it and shatters it against Dean’s face. \nThere is a moment where Dean falls to his hands and knees while the blood rushes in his\nears; there is a moment where Dean thinks, I want my father, and he is as small as he has ever\n\nbeen. \n“Dean,” says Cas, and oh—his voice thunders in this small room, not so much words as it is a\nstorm, a frisson of electricity—“close your eyes.”\nDean’s nose is broken, surely. Dean drips blood onto the carpet below his face, and chokes on\nit when it floods the back of his throat. Dean closes his eyes. \nThe room explodes. \nNow John screams, and it twists out of him like a mangled sheet of metal, and there is\nsomething wrong with Dean that he doesn’t leap to his feet to make the sound stop. That he\ndoesn’t want, with all of his being nor any shred of it, to get rid of whatever is so clearly\ncausing his father harm. \nThere’s nothing beyond the flimsy shield of Dean’s paper-thin eyelashes but impossible,\nincomprehensible light. Scalding blue and breathlessly bright. The heat of a sun on Dean’s\nskin. \nIt’s Cas. It’s Cas hurting that scream out of John Winchester, inhuman and all-powerful of\nhim—and yet Dean knows in his bones that he could lean into this light, into Cas, and be\nsafer than he’s ever been in his life. \nYou are an angry, pathetic, mean little man, says Cas. He isn’t speaking, but Dean\nunderstands him anyway. He resonates through Dean like a song. You do not deserve the\ngoodness of either of your sons, and you do not deserve the years of Dean’s life that he has\ndevoted to you. If you ever touch him again, I will find you, and I will end you. By the grace\nof God, John Winchester, this is a promise of mine. \nSlowly the light fades away, and with it the crackle of a lightning storm on Dean’s skin. \nThe room is silent. Just Dean, and the blood in his ears and on his tongue, and the rattle in his\nlungs. \nSomeone touches him between the shoulder blades. He flinches, hands skittering through the\nshattered glass that litters the floor beneath his knees, and Cas says, “Hush, Dean, shhh. You\nmay open your eyes now, it’s ok. You’re ok.”\nHe can only peel one open. The other is swollen shut along with that half of his face, already\ngoing sticky and matted with blood, and Cas is blurry where he kneels before Dean. \n“It’s alright,” Cas murmurs, cradling Dean’s face in his palms. Dean wishes he could see him\nclearly. “Dean, I’m so sorry.”\n“Dad,” Dean says, and every time his heart throbs it sends a pulse of pain through every inch\nof him. He’s crying, he realizes. He’s sobbing like a fucking child, and he doesn’t know if it’s\nthe pain or the fear or Cas’s hands on him, healing him like there’s no way he deserves. “Is he\n—what’s—”\n\n“John Winchester is incapacitated,” Cas says gently. He strokes beneath Dean’s eyes with the\npads of his thumbs and some of the pain leeches away. Slowly, Dean blinks open his other\neye. Slowly, Dean’s vision clears. “He won’t hurt you again.”\n“I’m fine,” babbles Dean, even though he clearly isn’t, even though he’s falling apart. “I’m\nok, it’s not that bad, Cas.”\nIt smells like whiskey down here on the floor, in the rubble; it’s splashed all down Dean’s\njacket, his hair, the carpet. Stringent and pungent. It turns Dean’s gut. \nDean was fifteen when his father gave him a drink for the first time. Dean was thirteen the\nfirst time he stole one. Dean was four when his father lifted him and his voice smelled like\nJack Daniels, and Dean was twenty-two when he found his father passed out in a gutter\nbehind a bar two nights after Sam left them, and Dean is twenty-three and the glass of a\nwhiskey bottle from his father’s hand is stuck in his cheek like gravel in a scraped knee. \n“It is that bad,” says Cas. His voice trembles, discomposed. Dean tries to breathe in but it’s\ncloser to a gasp, air clawing for purchase in his lungs, so Cas cups his jaw and suffuses Dean\nwith grace again, warm and lulling. “I am not a vengeful creature,” he murmurs. “I am not\nmade for unnecessary violence. But when I saw him hurt you I was angrier than I have been\nin ages. You don’t deserve that, Dean.”\nDean should get to his feet and clean all this up—the blood and the glass and the booze. He\nshould find John and make sure Cas didn’t fucking kill him. \nDean curls his hands around Cas’s wrists; leans his cheek into Cas’s palm. \nAs his vision clears completely and Cas comes fully into view, Dean tries not to react to how\nexhausted Cas looks. He’s paler than Dean’s ever seen him, lips white, sweat beaded along\nhis hairline; when he blinks it’s heavy and slow, like it takes work to lift his lids again. His\npulse beats birdwing fast beneath Dean’s fingertips. \n“Are you ok?” Dean asks him. He can’t see around Cas’s broad shoulders to where John was\nstanding before, and he doesn’t care to look. Dean’s blood is ground into the carpet where\nthey kneel. “Shit, Cas, did he hurt you?”\n“No,” Cas murmurs. His eyes are wet too, though he’s shaking in anger rather than whatever\nfucked up maelstrom of emotions is rocking Dean. “No, Dean, I’m alright. Just... exhausted.\nIt’s been a while since I took on my true form, and with my grace not quite as strong as it\nused to be, I’m tired.”\nAnd then he healed Dean, and that must have taken it out of him, too. Dean can’t stop crying.\nHe’s such an idiot.  \n“Your true form?” he asks. He’s holding onto Cas too tightly. “Is that—was that your grace?\nAll that light I couldn’t look at?”\nCas nods. “It’s too much for humans to bear. I’m still not as powerful as I once was, but\nthis... much of my grace has gotten stronger since I was sent here. To you.”\n\nToo much for humans to bear. Dean thinks of the warmth of it. The—the peace of it. The way\nhe wants to fall into Cas, weightless, and let himself be held. \n“God,” he breathes. “I bet you’re beautiful.”\nSomething in Cas’s face changes, softens. It almost hurts to be looked at this way. “Dean,” he\nsays, very quietly, and then nothing more. \nDean swallows, tight. That wasn’t—it wasn’t anything that Castiel just said, but for some\nreason rejection stings the surface of Dean’s newly-healed skin anyway. Jesus, he’s fucked\nup. He doesn’t ask Cas to stop touching him, because he doesn’t want to. \n“Ok,” Dean says, nodding. “Ok. Let’s take care of John.”\n \n*\n \nHe is flat on his back on the dirty carpet. The left side of his face is mangled and swollen,\nmatching what he’d done to Dean. Unconscious, but breathing. A thin trail of blood runs\ndown his neck from both ears. \n“He’ll be fine,” Cas says. He and Dean are both standing now, shoulder-to-shoulder. Holding\neach other up. “I didn’t kill your father. I know that would have been rude.”\nDean wants to laugh, or maybe sob again. He leans into Cas. “Thanks.”\n“Hm,” Cas says. “I think we should leave him here. Perhaps he’ll believe he had an accident\nwhen he sees the glass, or perhaps not.” Cas tilts his head, gazing down at John with\ncontempt. “I would wipe his memory, but I believe he won’t remember any of this anyway.”\n“Please wipe it,” Dean says. “If it’s not gonna take too much out of you. I don’t want him to\nwake up and...” \nDean doesn’t say it. Doesn’t have to. Cas looks at him, serious as a heart attack. “I meant\nwhat I said,” he murmurs. “I won’t let him touch you again as long as it’s within my power to\nstop him.”\n“I know, Cas,” Dean says, and he does. But still. Still. \nCas nods. Bends, and places two fingers on John’s bruised forehead, letting a wisp of grace\nsink beneath his skin. \nDean steadies Cas as he stands. Before they go, he turns John on his side. \n \n*\n\n \nThere isn’t another motel in this town so Dean drives an hour to the next one, his time nearly\ndoubled by the thick fall of snow on the uncleared road. \nHe’s got a tension headache by the time he finds a place, and his eyes sting with the effort to\nkeep them open—even Cas, who doesn’t technically sleep, looks like he’s nodding off over\nthere with his cheek resting on the glass of Baby’s window. \nThey don’t talk as Dean grabs his duffel from the back. Cas touches the curve of Dean’s\nelbow, and Dean lets him, and they stomp through the drifts and into the lobby. \nA sleepy-looking teenager mans the front desk, painting her nails black while she reads a\nbook held open with the computer mouse and a cup of pens. She doesn’t even look at Dean as\nhe gets them a room, and makes sure that they can tell she’s annoyed at being interrupted as\nshe slides across their key. “Have a good night,” Dean says a little pointedly, and she rolls her\neyes without tearing her gaze away from the page. \nIt takes a minute to get the door unlocked. Dean’s so fucking tired. Dean’s so—he gets the\nkey in the right direction this time, face hot, and shoulders the door open. \nThe icing on the fucking cake of the shittiest day he’s had in half a goddamn year is that the\nkid didn’t even give them the right room. Dean knows he asked for two doubles but there’s\njust one king sitting there in the middle of the floor, off-white sheets and bowed middle and\nall, and Dean lets out a sigh so long he feels it in the bottoms of his feet. \n“It’s fine, Dean,” Cas says, before Dean can even march himself back down to the lobby and\nraise hell. He’s still got his fingers tucked in the crook of Dean’s elbow, all gentle like they’re\na couple of ladies in the eighteen-hundreds going for a stroll, but his hand slips all the way\naround and tightens and suddenly it’s a feat of strength not to turn into his chest and go to\nsleep on Dean’s goddamn feet. “Do you really mind?”\n“No,” Dean mumbles. He lets his duffel fall into the chair by the door and starts toeing off his\nboots. “Thought you might.”\n“I don’t sleep,” Cas says automatically, and then at Dean’s look, softer, “No. I don’t mind at\nall.”\nDean nods, wordless. It’s easier just to do what Cas says. Dean’s done thinking for today.\nDean just wants—Dean wants—\n“Come along,” Cas says to him. He helps Dean shrug off his coat like Dean’s little or\nsomething, and Dean knows he should protest, but it feels so damn nice to be taken care of.\n“You need to rest.”\n“You too,” Dean mumbles, tugging on the lapel of Cas’s coat. “You’re wiped out, man, don’t\ntry to hide it. At least lay down.”\n\nCas watches him for a moment. Then he slips out of his coat and jacket, folds them both\nproperly in half, and drapes them over the chair as well. \nOh. Dean was right. Cas is jacked under that ugly thing. \nDean drags his eyes away, stumbling into a pair of sweatpants as Cas takes his shoes off. \nThe both climb into the bed, and Dean buries himself down beneath the covers without\npreamble. It should all be a lot more awkward than it is—Cas is propped up against the\nheadboard above Dean, looking down at him as Dean surfs the three channels their TV gets\nfor something to fall asleep to, and Dean’s head is so close to Cas’s hip that he might as well\ngo all the way and tuck it onto his lap—but instead Dean feels himself start to breathe easy\nfor the first time all day. \nWhen he feels Cas’s hand in his hair, carding so carefully, he pushes into it like a cat with\nbarely any shame. \nHe settles on an infomercial channel, the volume turned down low. He closes his eyes. \n“You didn’t seem surprised,” Cas says after a while. His nails scratch at the tender scalp\nbehind Dean’s ear, sending a shiver down his spine. He’s quiet. “When your father... when\nhe hit you.”\nDean’s breath goes tight again, a taught handful of panic in his throat. “I dunno how much\nyou know about Dad—”\n“Enough,” Cas interrupts darkly. \n“He tried, Cas,” Dean whispers, keeping his eyes closed. “I ain’t—I don’t—I know things\ncould’ve been... better. And I know some of the stuff he did to me was, was wrong. I know\nthat. But his life hasn’t been perfect either. And he’s my dad. He’s my dad, Cas.”\nCas doesn’t answer. Just touches Dean with so much care, right over the place where he’d\nbeen bleeding from an hour ago. \n“I think I hate him sometimes, Cas,” Dean whispers. “I love him—of course I love him—but\ndammit, I hate him, too. And I am—there’s something wrong with me, and maybe that’s why\nI feel like this, because when he looks at me I can tell all he sees is whatever’s... whatever’s\nrotten in me. He makes me remember what a piece of shit I am.”\nDean knows what this is. This is hatred reflected back on the self back onto the source, an\nendless loop that he ain’t ever going to break free from. He hates the man his father made\nhim into, and his father hates the man Dean has become, and Dean hates the man who gave\nhim life in the first place, on and on in an unbroken cycle. \nHe sucks in a shuddering breath, and Cas catches the dampness beneath Dean’s eyes. Dean\ndidn’t even know he was crying again until Cas did that. \n“Dean,” says Cas in his low, roughshod voice. “Please sit up so I can look at you.”\n\nHe does, pulling the blankets around him as he does so, but he can’t meet Cas’s eyes. Not\nyet. \nCas ducks his chin down to find them anyway. \nThey’re in a shitty little motel in the middle of nowhere. Cas has been at Dean’s side for\nweeks. Cas wanted to kill Dean’s father for hurting him. Cas is beautiful like this, and Dean\nknows he’s beautiful in his true form, too. Cas is still touching Dean more softly than he’s\nbeen touched since his mother died. \n“You will never remember this,” Cas says, low, “but the first time I’ll ever meet you, I will\ntouch your soul. You will have gone through unbelievable horror before I can reach you, the\nlikes of which would extinguish a lesser person like snuffing a candle—but not you. I will see\nyou for the first time in untold darkness, and taking you in my hands, so resplendent despite\nyour scars, will be like trying to hold onto the sun. Even though you’ll be in immeasurable\npain, I will look at you and I will think you are so good. And I will never change my mind.”\nCas looks nearly naked sitting here in just his shirtsleeves, and still more exhausted than\nDean’s ever seen him, with the dim blue glow of the TV screen shining back in his eyes,\nturning the shadows beneath them deep and boundless. Dean looks at him until something in\nhis chest gives. \nHe bends forward and brushes Cas’s mouth with his. \nDean waits one beat, two, three, every inch of him poised for the moment that Cas pushes\nhim away—but that moment never comes. Cas’s mouth is warm and yielding beneath Dean’s;\nCas makes a soft punctured sound, and his hands come up as if to hold Dean to him, one at\nhis jaw and one gentle at the side of his neck. \nA pause. Dean breathes, his eyes closed, and Cas murmurs “Dean,” with their mouths still\ntouching. \nIt’s humiliating, the way Dean shivers at that. Cas pulls him back in and kisses him again and\nagain and again, slow, lingering presses, and oh, Dean thinks, oh, this is dangerous. \nCas’s lips are parted when he leans in again. Dean winds his hands into Cas’s shirt collar. \n“Dean,” says Cas again, rougher, and Dean can feel the beat of his carotid on the side of his\nhand. Cas thumbs the notch of Dean’s jaw. “What do you want?”\nIt shouldn’t be a question that slices him through the middle as if he is soft dough. It\nshouldn’t have him going still on his knees in the V of Cas’s legs, suddenly immobile with\nindecision. But it does. \nWhat does he want? Everything. Everything and more, with a hunger that has teeth. \nHe lets his forehead come to rest at the crook of Cas’s neck; he places a kiss there, and listens\nto Cas’s next inhale tremble. “Want you,” Dean whispers. \n\nCas makes an overwhelmed sound, low in the back of his throat. He slips a hand down\nDean’s spine and spans his waist with the width of his palm, thumb pressed into the soft give\nof Dean’s hip, and pulls Dean closer until Dean has no choice but to straddle Cas’s thighs; he\nsinks down onto them, still mouthing at Cas’s warm neck, and his stomach swoops wildly\nwhen Cas cups his nape. \nIt feels good. A little possessive, in a slow burn liquid-heat kinda way. It feels like Cas wants\nhim back. \n“You,” breathes Cas. He slides his hand around to Dean’s chin, lifts it up so Dean has to meet\nhis eyes. Cas’s are gorgeous. Brimming, full of something Dean can’t quite name. “You\noverwhelm me.”\nDean laughs weakly. “You’re one to talk.”\nCas smiles. For a second there’s so much clashing joy and sorrow on his face that Dean has\nto lean in and kiss him again, just so he doesn’t go blind. \nNot like it’s a hardship. \nThey make out for a while, hands roaming, hearts beating. Dean catches each small sound\nCas makes down in the pit of his chest and vows to keep it there, secret and safe, even as he\nmakes a couple of his own. \nIt’s so different kissing Cas—different in a way that has Dean feeling like he’s about to\ncollapse softly inward. Dean’s exhausted, emotionally and physically, but that don’t seem to\nmatter: he feels shivery and kindled and unmoored all over, cast out to drift and burning up at\nthe same time. Cas sweeps his hand up Dean’s spine once more and Dean’s whole body\nbends into the movement, arching toward his every touch with the sort of hunger that Dean\nhas always done his best to starve to death. \nDangerous, dangerous. Now that he’s got this, he’s never gonna be able to let go. \n“You are so beautiful,” Cas rumbles against the skin of Dean’s throat. He’s as intense and\ndedicated in touching Dean as he is doing anything else; he kisses Dean again, again, open-\nmouthed and warm beneath his jaw and over his Adam’s apple, leaving no inch of flesh\nuntouched. \nDean’s shaking apart. “Shut up,” he murmurs. \nCas mouths at his pulse point. “Why would I do that?\"\n“That ain’t...” Dean’s voice is rough, trips over itself. His eyelids lower down as he pauses,\nand one hand winds its way into the thick dark hair at the back of Cas’s head. “That ain’t the\nsort of thing people say to me. That’s shit that gets said to hot chicks in movies.”\nCas pulls back, and Dean lets the small disappointed noise out of his throat before he can\nthink to stop it. Cas smiles at him, slow; he reaches up and skims the pad of his index finger\nalong Dean’s bottom lip, back and forth and back again. \n\n“Why is that an adjective exclusive to attractive women?” he asks. “It’s the truth; you are\nremarkably beautiful, and it brings me great pleasure to tell you so.” He pauses, his eyes\nflickering across Dean’s flushed face, and his voice drops low when he says, “I believe it\nbrings you pleasure to hear it, as well.”\nDean’s gonna go supernova. Self-immolate right here on his angel’s lap, more turned on than\nhe’s ever been. \n“Cas,” he gets out. He can barely speak, tongue thick and slow in his throat. “I...”\nHe’s not sure what makes him do it; just that Cas is looking at him so closely, eyes heated\nand hooded, and Dean is half-high on being touched like this, and—and when Cas traces\nDean’s mouth again Dean tips his head forward slightly, taking Cas’s finger into wet heat of\nhis mouth. \n“Oh Dean, ” Cas says, more of a groan than a word. It is thrilling, knowing Dean’s affecting\nCas just as much as Cas is affecting him; Cas’s head falls back to rest against the headboard\nfor a second, lips a little swollen, a little parted, and Dean shivers again as he circles Cas’s\nfingertip with his tongue. \nThe hand on Dean’s hip slides forward, nudging up his t-shirt and stroking at his stomach\nbefore drifting forward to flirt with the waistband of his sweats. Dean’s pulse leaps. Cas says,\n“May I?” so polite and formal and enchanting in his awkwardness, so fucking hot in how\nstraightforward he is, and Dean nods fast as he clings to Cas’s wrist and takes another finger\nin his mouth. \nCas’s breath stutters. It’s visible: that jagged movement of his chest. He tugs at Dean’s sweats\nand Dean raises up slightly on shaky knees so Cas can tug them down to Dean’s thighs, still\nlapping at the slightly-salty taste of Cas’s skin. \nCas leans in to kiss the corner of Dean’s full mouth, Dean’s mouth which is full of Castiel’s\nown hand, and Cas wraps his other hand around Dean’s cock and something in Dean cries\nout.\n“Look at you,” Cas says. He sounds reverent. He swipes his thumb over Dean’s cockhead and\nDean tightens his fingers around Cas’s wrist, holding tight so he doesn’t buck up into Cas’s\nfist—and Cas catches this restraint, because of course he does. He kisses Dean again, jacks\nhim a little clumsy and entirely overwhelming, says, “That’s it, Dean, don’t hold back. Show\nme. Show me how you feel.”\nDean would roll his eyes or say something glib if the center of his universe hadn’t shrunk\ndown to this bed, to Cas, to the points where they touch. Cas slips his fingers free but keeps\nDean’s mouth open with a thumb beneath his chin and a finger on his bottom lip, guiding him\ninto a kiss that starts off warm and wet and leaves Dean as shattered as the hand sliding\nfriction-rough up and down his shaft. Dean clings to Cas’s shoulders. \nDean lets his hips thrust forward and Cas’s roll upward, and—and Cas is hard through his\nsuit pants, and Dean moans against his open mouth. \n\nHe doesn’t realize he’s scrabbling at the buttons of Cas’s shirt until Cas pulls away to undo\nthem for Dean, his mouth red and wet and smiling, his pupils huge. Dean dives in to kiss him\nagain, not caring in the slightest that he just slows down the process. \n“You too, Dean, please,” Cas says as soon as he shrugs his shirt off. He’s slipping his palms\nup Dean’s stomach again, tugging Dean’s t-shirt as he goes, so Dean just lifts his arms\nweakly and lets Cas pull it over his head. \nThey look at each other for a moment, bare chests heaving. \nThey’ve barely done anything. Already Dean knows he’s changed. \n“What do you want?” Cas asks again, and the words are tender on his tongue. He can’t stop\ntouching Dean: his hands map Dean’s shoulders, his chest, his upper abs and his soft belly.\n“You know I would do anything for you, if only you’d ask.” \nCas’s hair is sticking up everywhere, downy, untameable. Because of Dean. Dean did that. \nSomehow, it’s easier to answer him this time. “Just keep touchin’ me, Cas,” he breathes.\n“Please don’t stop.”\nCas doesn’t answer him, but he doesn’t need to. He drifts forward. He finds Dean’s mouth\nagain. \nThey kiss for a long time, but something about it is slower now, unhurried, intense in the\nkinda way that builds and builds beneath the surface of Dean’s skin. Dean lets himself touch\nevery part of Cas that he’s been longing for weeks to touch: his broad strong shoulders, his\nforearms, the point of his chin and the divot between his eyebrows and thick, muscled width\nof his thighs. He slips off of Cas’s lap so he can tug away his sweats and has Cas do the same,\nand when he climbs back up Cas flips them so Dean is spread beneath him, gazing up at the\nfever-flush of Cas’s face. \nDean fucks into Cas’s fist without shame now, his skin buzzing hot; Cas ruts against Dean’s\nhip, and each punched-out breath of air he releases gets caught up in the seal of Dean’s\nmouth. \n“You’re beautiful,” Cas says again, panting hot into the hollow of Dean’s throat. He strokes\nhis hand up Dean’s arm, pins his wrist to the pillow beneath his head. His hips falter, rhythm\nshot with his approaching release. “You are so wonderful, so incredibly singular. I took one\nlook at your soul, Dean Winchester, and was irrevocably changed.” \n“Cas,” Dean sobs out, gripping the back of his neck like a lifeline. Something surges beneath\nhis skin, bigger than bone or blood. \n“You’re so good,” Cas whispers. \n“Jesus,” Dean gasps, “ Cas .”\nDean comes like that, Cas’s name held in his mouth. \n\nHe’s kissing Cas again before he can even catch his breath, hungry though he’s just been\nsated, mouth moving lazily as Cas tightens his grip on Dean’s wrist and grinds messily down\nagainst him. “C’mon,” Dean murmurs, mouth sticking slick to Cas’s as they both pant.\n“C’mon, baby, come on me, Cas.”\nCas shudders against Dean. With one last roll of his hips, with a moan stifled against Dean’s\nskin, Cas does. \nAfter, Cas cleans them up with a flick of his wrist and a tinge of grace that ghosts sunbeam-\nwarm over Dean’s bare skin. He rolls off of Dean but pulls him close, and Dean tugs the\nblankets up over both of them, chest so full as Cas wraps his arms around him and kisses him\ngently that he thinks he might cleave in two. \nThey stay like that, trading sleepy touches in the blue light of the television screen. It feels so\ngood. So unbelievably good that Dean almost wants to thank him. \n“Thank you,” whispers Cas, quiet across the pillow. Dean has to bury his face in Cas’s neck.\nDean has to hold on. \n“Don’t have to thank me,” Dean says. “I—I—s’not like it was a chore, Cas.”\nCas laughs his low quiet laugh, vibrating pleasantly against Dean’s skin. “All the same,” he\nmurmurs. “I am grateful.”\nAmen to that. \nDean falls asleep with Cas’s arms around him. With the beat of Cas’s heart beneath his ear. \nChapter End Notes\ngenuinely from the bottom of my heart writing this chapter fucked me up\n\nChapter 6\nChapter Summary\nIt feels good to wake up held by someone.\nIt feels good to wake up held by Cas.\nChapter Notes\nSee the end of the chapter for notes\nThere is a boy standing in front of Dean, and he wears Cas’s face. \n“Sam wanted me to tell you that there’s dinner in the kitchen, and to please come eat it this\ntime,” the boy says. He stands in the door frame with his hands empty and open at his sides\nin a way that reminds Dean of Cas, and in the shadowed golden light emitting from the lamp\nbeside Dean, his eyes hold something that Dean can’t name. \nDean doesn’t recognize the room he’s in. It stands tall around him, walls covered in shelves\nof books that look like the dusty things Bobby’s got laying around at his place. He sits at a\ntable, three or four of those books lying open around him. The chair is uncomfortable: puts\npain at the base of his spine, his hip, his knee where it rests gingerly extended beneath the\ntabletop.\nDean is... he is weary. Bone-deep and ancient. \nThe boy in the doorway moves, calling Dean’s attention back up to him. It’s hard to focus on\nanything, the edges of every sensation around him slightly numb—all but this hollow ache\ninside the cradle of his rib cage. This wailing sorrow that he’s actively swallowing down. \n“It’s working, Dean,” the boy tells him, and he’s gotten closer now and Dean didn’t notice,\nand... and it’s a matching sorrow in his eyes, Dean sees. Brimful and heart wrenching. “I—I\npromise. I can feel him. We’ll get him back.”\nDean looks at him. At his downturned mouth and his blue eyes, at the softness of his hair\nwhere it falls across his forehead. At his slim shoulders, bowed with the burden of this pain\nthey share between them. \nDean looks at him and sees Cas. Dean looks at him and sees Sammy. \nHe doesn’t know this boy. He doesn’t—he doesn’t think—\nDean wants to comfort him. \n\nHe lifts his hand, watches the boy’s hands twist restlessly in the hem of his t-shirt, and says,\nquiet, “Jack.”\nThere’s a heartbeat in this room, and it presses down on them both. It gets loud like yelling in\nDean’s ears. He can taste it on his tongue. \nJack’s face crumples when Dean takes his hand in both of his. \n“I’m trying,” Jack whispers. \nThere is something inside of Dean that sobs long and low and lonely, like wind through an\nabandoned house. \n“Me too,” he says. \n \n*\n \nDean wakes up with his heart beating too fast, with his breath twisting harshly out of his\nlungs. \nHe’s in a bed. He’s... warm, all over, but especially all along his back, and—\nCas is breathing slowly at the nape of Dean’s neck. Peacefully. His arm is heavy around\nDean’s waist, one big hand tucked up along the softness of Dean’s belly. He’s got a leg\nwound up between two of Dean’s, and his other arm nestled beneath Dean’s head so that his\ncheek rests on Cas’s bicep, so that he can see the loose curl of his fingers on the pillow\nbeyond his face, the fleshy dip of his palm, the ridge of his knuckles, all lax with sleep. He’s\nholding Dean.\nIt feels good to wake up held by someone. \nIt feels good to wake up held by Cas.\nDoesn’t offset the panic that’s rocketing through him right now, though, kicking at him and\npushing away what’s left of how drowsy and good and languid sleeping in Cas’s arms makes\nhim feel. \nIt’s the dream weighing on him—though he doesn’t truly believe they’re dreams anymore,\nand they surely aren’t memories; it’s like he’s really living them, swapped out with some\nother Dean he hasn’t gotten to be yet—but it’s everything that happened yesterday, too.\nLosing all those kids, letting ‘em die. John, and what he’d done, and the horrible guilty relief\nDean had felt at seeing him there on the floor. \nCas. And kissing him, and being kissed by him. And, and, and. \n\nDean’s eyes are still pressed tightly closed, but he must have stirred when he awoke. Cas\nmakes a snuffling sort of wakeful noise behind him now, the air of his voice stirring the hairs\nat the base of Dean’s skull, and tugs Dean closer to him, nuzzling at his skin. \n“Dean,” Cas rumbles, rubbing his cheek along the top of Dean’s spine like a cat seeking\naffection. He sounds blissful, he sounds. He sounds delighted by Dean. Dean wants to shrink\ninto the heat of him. “Good morning.”\nThe sound just falls out of Dean, unbidden, unwanted. Small and high and shameful, a needy\nlittle thing that he wants to shove back inside himself with a fist as soon as it escapes. \nBut Cas doesn’t seem to think he should. Cas caresses Dean’s flesh where he touches him\nbeneath the blankets, palm skimming from Dean’s bellybutton to his hip to his sternum to the\nwing of his ribs; he pulls his other arm free until he can prop himself up with it, and then he\nleans down and burrows a lingering kiss into the pink flush of Dean’s cheekbone. \nInstinct. That’s what’s got Dean turning his face up as Cas lifts back to breathe, and that’s\nwhat’s got him meeting Cas’s mouth with his. That, and this sweet-edged desire inside him\nthat makes him sing. \nCas hums, low and a little rough, and melts into it. He licks past the seam of Dean’s sleep-\nsoft lips and Dean lets him in, cupping the pointed slope of Cas’s jaw in his hand even as his\nheart continues to thud. \nHe wants to shift back and press himself between Cas’s thighs. \nCas retreats to let Dean sip of the air between them, but he doesn’t shift away at all: stays\nright there against Dean’s skin like the living thing he is, sturdy gentle heat within Dean’s\nreach, and looks at him. \nThoughts clamor at Dean’s mind, too many to untangle, to sort through. There are more\nimportant things lined up in the wrong order; what comes out, rough with tiredness and\nkissing and doing a piss-poor job at being casual is, “I thought angels don’t sleep.”\nCas rolls his eyes. The gesture manages to be fond despite the mild exasperation, and Dean\nthinks—Dean thinks that maybe it’s just Cas. Maybe it’s just how he looks at Dean, every\nDean, regardless of what they’ve done to him. What they’ve had him do. \n“Angels don’t usually access their trueform after years of being unable to do to a finite\namount of grace,” Cas says. He’s using a bitchy little tone, but he’s still touching Dean,\nrunning that palm in wide gentle swaths, leaving tingles in its wake. “Forgive me for\nrequiring rest.”\n“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says. Somehow his hand has found its way to the back of Cas’s head,\nfingers wound up in his dark hair. He runs his thumb along the pink arch of Cas’s ear, and\nCas’s eyelids flutter briefly closed. Voice smaller, Dean asks, “You’re ok, right?”\nCas turns his head. Kisses the center of Dean’s palm. \n\n“Yes, Dean,” Cas murmurs. “I’m ok.”\nDean swallows hard, throat thick with something as yet unnamed. “You still got bags beneath\nyour eyes.”\nCas tilts into Dean’s touch and Dean obliges him: he touches the corner of Cas’s eye where\nlaugh lines have gathered as if he can take that shape up within his own skin and keep it\nforever. \n“I always look like that,” Cas says. He bends forward and kisses Dean’s forehead, so\nunexpectedly tender that Dean’s eyes immediately spring hot. He has to close them. “We’re\nalright, Dean. We are.”\nDean nods. Doesn’t look up. \nThey’re still for a moment, wrapped up in each other and in the blankets, touching with\ntentative exploratory touches like they hadn’t made each other come last night on these same\ndamn sheets. Like Cas don’t turn Dean on more than any woman he’s ever tried desperately\nto be into. \nAnd that’s part of the reason Dean still can’t quite get a full breath in this morning, isn’t it?\nDean wants him because he’s Cas —but Dean wants him because he’s a him, too. \nHe’s probably holding onto Cas too tightly, but he can’t let go. “You’re, uh. You’re the first\nguy I’ve kissed since I was sixteen,” he blurts. “First guy I’ve ever been with.”\nIf Cas is discomfited by the non sequitur, well, Dean don’t fuckin’ know because he’s not\nabout to open his eyes now. Not after saying that stupid shit. Not after opening his big damn\nmouth and letting all that out like letting all the infection out of a wound, that seeping aching\npain that he shoulda just let live inside him until it ate him alive. \n“Do you know that already?” Dean asks him before Cas can get an answer in. He’s suddenly\ngrippingly afraid that this is a part of himself that’s gotten revealed before he was ready,\nbefore he allowed it to, and it makes his chest tight. “Have I told you that before?” \n“No,” Cas says quietly. There is something all caught up behind his voice, like hesitancy or\ncaution, and Dean bristles at it even as he’s grateful. Relieved. “It’s not something we’ve ever\ndiscussed.”\nDean nods. Nods again. Now that Cas has told him that, he’s not sure if it’s worse. That Cas,\nsomeone he seems to know so well in the future, someone who he seems to care about so\ndeeply, still doesn’t know this part of him. \nSometimes Dean thinks he doesn’t even know this part of himself. \nIt’s so—it’s so damn easy for everybody else. Sammy. John. Men who can look in the mirror\nand see everything they are right there on the surface, good and normal or even angry and\nbroken and obsessed. They are what people expect of them. They have nothing beneath their\nskin that the whole world frowns at; that the whole world would hate them for. \n\nIt ain’t about the whole world right now, though. It’s just about Dean. \n“You’ve slept with men since I’ve known you,” Cas says in his usual blunt way, and keeps\ntouching Dean like he’s afraid to press in too hard. Dean wonders if this is something they’ve\nfought about. If this is a secret only in the frailest sense of the word. Dean thinks that if Cas\nstops touching him, he’ll lose it. “Not that we’ve addressed it. There were times that you\nsimply... didn’t hide it.”\nAnd there it is: that hesitancy again. That thing beneath Castiel’s eyes that’s thin as tissue\npaper, that Dean at once yearns for and is terrified to rip away. \nDean digs his blunt fingers into the meat of Cas’s shoulder, searching for a grip that’s offered\nto him without pause. \n“With you?” he asks. His throat’s so dry. “Have I—have we...”\nHe’s grown to hate the sorrow that Cas wears so well. \n“No,” Cas murmurs again. \nIt should surprise Dean—he wants it to surprise him so badly, to believe he has, just once,\nasked for something that he wants—but it doesn’t. He’s a coward. He puts on a brave face,\nbut killing monsters is easy when your other option is telling somebody how you feel. \nDean holds the curve of Cas’s jaw like the precious thing he is. “I love you though,” he rasps.\n“Don’t I?”\nCas’s eyes have grown wet as he gazes down at Dean. He smiles, small and tremulous and\nsad, and it breaks Dean’s goddamn heart. \n“I think so, Dean. You’ve never said so out loud, but you... you don’t have to.”\nIt’s a damn shame that he’s never said so to Cas, because the guy deserves to hear it as often\nas he wants. Every day, if it’ll make him smile like that. \n“Can I tell you something?” Dean says, and his voice only shakes a little. “I’m a damn\ncoward, but I think that guy you had to leave back there in the future is going crazy without\nyou. I think—I think every time you leave him it tears him up inside but he can’t tell you,\n‘cuz telling you would make it real. Cas, I think he loves you so goddamn much he’s stupid\nwith it.”\nCas tucks his face down into the hollow of Dean’s throat, hand going tight on his waist. Dean\nfeels him breathe there. Just feels him breathe. \n“I love you too,” Cas says, and then he laughs wetly against Dean’s pulse, and Dean smiles\neven though he hurts inside. He’s gonna lose Cas soon—and he’s gonna lose him again in the\nfuture—but god, it’s good just to have him now. “I love you so much, Dean.”\nDean kisses the top of his head. It’s messy with sleep, and with Cas’s natural state of being,\nand Dean wants to eat him whole. \n\nThere must be so much love in this man. To love a Dean he’s known so long, and a Dean he’s\nonly just met. \n“I know I’m not your Dean—”\n“You are,” Cas cuts in swiftly. He lifts his head, and his eyes are red, irises standing out\nshock-blue. “You are my Dean. Always.”\nAnd what the hell can Dean say to that?\nHe kisses him. \nThere’s as much emotion behind it as there was last night, but it’s different now. Dean’s not\nburying himself in Cas for protection, for sanctuary; he holds onto him because he wants to,\nand because Cas wants him to, and because that inextricable pull between them that Dean’s\nbeen conscious of since the moment they met has tugged taught as a rubber band, looping\nthem together.  \nCas nips at Dean’s bottom lip, hands roaming, breath ragged. He’s enthusiastic and thorough,\ncataloging every inch of Dean like there’s no other creature on this earth he’d rather study:\nwhen Dean lets out a high, breathy sound at the heat of Cas’s wet mouth on the soft pocket\nbeneath his jaw, Cas doubles down and repeats the movement again, again, again, so devoted\nto Dean’s pleasure that Dean almost wants to shrink from the focus. \nAlmost. The rest of him fuckin’ glows golden, tilting faceward into his touch like a flower\ntilts toward the sun.\nDean is hard beneath the blankets—has been since he woke up and felt Cas breathing there at\nthe back of his neck—and when Cas shifts so he’s more fully straddling Dean’s hips, Dean\nfeels that he is, too. \nSomething ignites itself way down in Dean’s bones at the slow, deliberate roll of Cas’s\nerection against his.\n“Cas,” Dean says breathlessly, and paws at his cheek, “Cas, c’mere.”\nCas’s eyes are half-lidded when he lifts his head to look at Dean, sleepy and smoky and mile-\ndeep. His mouth is kiss-swollen, flushed—Dean wonders what he looks like. If his skin is\npink and raw, rubbed that way by Cas’s stubble, by his lovely, insistent mouth. \n“Are you alright?” Cas asks heavily. \nHe’s so kind to Dean, so perfect, always making sure Dean’s ok and that Dean feels good and\nthat Dean’s needs are met. Well it’s Dean’s turn now. It’s Dean’s turn to take care of him.\nDean’s turn to make him feel so good that he smiles that too-rare blinding smile. \n“Cas,” Dean husks again, a hand on his chest to nudge him back to sitting. “Let me suck you\noff.”\nCas goes a little dopey-looking at that. Dean smiles. \n\nThey never redressed last night, so all they have to do now is scramble around in the pale\ngray morning light and situate themselves until Cas is leaning back against the headboard,\nDean kneeling between his legs. They laugh a little when Dean thwacks his elbow against\nCas’s knee on accident; Dean goes head-rush breathless stupid for the tenderness behind\nCas’s grin. \nDean clears his throat, steadying himself with a purposefully light grip on Cas’s big thighs. \n“I’ve never done this before,” he says. He knows he’s blushing from the roots of his hair to\nthe top of his stomach, freckles standing out dark against embarrassed skin, but strangely—\nstrangely he can’t quite bring himself to care. He’s never been in love before, either. Next to\nthat, it’s all just small stuff. “So, uh. Yeah. Just so you know.”\n“You don’t have to, Dean,” Cas says, trailing his fingertips down the splotches of color on\nDean’s chest. Slow and steady, like connecting constellations. \n“I want to,” Dean says, surprising himself with the fierceness of his voice. He bends forward\nsuddenly and kisses the side of Cas’s knee, all that warm skin, only feeling halfway stupid for\nit. “I want to take care of you.”\nCas’s breath is unsteady in his chest, a fledgling. Low, he says, “Dean.”\n“Let me,” Dean whispers. “Let me make you feel good.”\nHe watches Cas close his eyes for a moment as the words seem to wash over him. Watches a\ntight swallow travel down the line of his throat. Watches him nod. \nDean lowers himself down, and takes Cas’s cock into his mouth. \nIt is awkward, right off the bat, and slightly clumsy. Dean is too eager and much too full of\nhimself, tries too hard to take too much of Cas into his throat at once and has to pull back. He\nfeels like shit at first—he wants this to be good for Cas so badly, he wants, he wants to be\ngood for Cas—but Cas makes a soft, gut-punch noise of pleasure at the flex of Dean’s throat\naround him even though Dean gags a little, a hand going to rest cupped over Dean’s temple,\nand the knot of tension in Dean’s shoulder blades relaxes. \nHe knows Cas doesn’t mind. Cas doesn’t mind that Dean can’t take him all the way in one\nsmooth motion, or that he can’t fuck in hard until he hits the back of Dean’s throat, or that\nDean wraps loose fist around the base of Cas’s cock and jacks him with more hunger than\nskill. \nCas likes it. That hand on Dean’s head tightens, fingers winding through Dean’s hair. \nAfter a moment of adjustment, Dean sinks into the movement. He loves the weight of Cas on\nhis tongue. The place where his tip presses into Dean’s cheek, and the salt-musk taste of him,\nand the little sounds he makes when Dean laps at the vein running along the underside of his\ncock or slides his hand back to roll Cas’s balls in his hands. \n\n“Dean,” Cas says, breathless. He tugs at Dean’s hair, like a reflex—and something bright\ngold shivers its way from Dean’s scalp all the way down his spine, turns him light and\nboneless. “Oh, Dean. ”\nDean hums contentedly around Cas. His jaw hurts some from holding it open this long, spit\nruns down his chin from the corners of his mouth and it’s sloppy and too wet, his muscles\nshake with the tension of keeping this position, with the chill of the room around him, with\nthat need inside of him to make this perfect—but Dean doesn’t care. He can tell Cas is\nholding himself back from thrusting right down Dean’s throat, can tell he’s almost panting\nwith pleasure, and that knowledge alone makes Dean glow. \n“Look at you,” Cas whispers unsteadily. He said something like that last night, too. Like\nDean is wondrous. Like Dean is a marvel. There is so much gentleness in the thrum of Cas’s\nvoice that Dean could die from it. “You are so good, Dean. So good, perfect—and mine.” \nHe tugs on Dean’s hair again as he says it, and Dean can’t help the mewl that brings forth. He\ndoesn't want Cas to hold back anymore. He wants Cas to drive into him with everything he\nhas, to take his pleasure from Dean until he’s satisfied. \n“You like that, don’t you?” Cas asks him. His voice is a rough throb—and Christ, he’s got a\nmouth on him. Dean is nothing but the inferno inside himself. “When I call you mine?”\nIt’s a rhetorical question if Dean’s ever heard one, because the answer’s fucking obvious.\nHe’s hard between his own thighs, rutting desperately and without much concentration\nagainst the rucked-up sheets between him, arousal mounting in his belly with every word Cas\nsays. \nCas is the one getting his dick sucked, but Dean’s the one falling apart. \nDean drifts away on the rhythm of it. Feels himself relax even further after an amount of time\nthat passes him by like a lazy current, somehow able to take more of Cas’s length down his\nthroat between one shudder and the next. Cas is murmuring to him, fervid things between the\nragged tatter-panting of his breath, but his voice is shapeless, wordless: all that falls upon\nDean’s ears is that thunderstorm voice, the rolling building aching love in it, the evidence that\nDean is doing what he is supposed to, Dean is taking care of him, Dean is making him feel\ngood. That Dean is good. \nWhen Cas tugs Dean off of his cock with a firm, guiding hand, Dean moans. \n“I know,” Cas whispers to him, low and jagged. “I know, Dean, just, I was going to come and\nI don’t want to yet. Not yet.”\nDean feels limp, drunk on the conflagration of desire stoked just to the left of his sternum.\nHe’s putty in Cas’s hands. He licks the taste of Cas off his lips. \n“Shit,” Cas swears, so fervent and filthy in its rarity that it sends a bolt of flame through\nDean’s core. His eyes are all pupil now, sweat beaded along his sooty hairline, and his hands\nshake when he reaches out to tug Dean up to him so he can kiss any last bit of control Dean\nwithheld right the fuck out of him. \n\n“You are so,” Cas murmurs, but the rest of it gets stuck. He pulls Dean’s thigh up and over\nhis hips, situates him so that Dean’s face is in the crook of Cas’s neck and Cas can grasp\ndesperately at Dean’s waist. Dean licks the salt-taste from the line of Cas’s neck, blood\nrollicking in his ears so loudly that he can barely hear Cas’s answering gasp. “Dean,” Cas\nwhispers, a prayer, a plea, and then, “ Dean,” and wraps his big hand around both of them\nbetween their stomachs. \n“Love you, Cas,” Dean slurs. He’s glad it isn’t the first time. The words pour out of him,\nsecret themselves into the warmth of Cas’s skin. He couldn’t stop them if he wanted to. \nCas’s hand speeds up, breath rising with it. \nDean grips Cas’s hand beneath his own, not really helping, but not willing to let go either. He\njust needs to be touching Cas. Needs to be as close to him as physically possible, and then\ncloser still, wants to climb into his chest and stay there pressed up to his spinal cord and live\noff the marrow between his bones. \nHe isn’t sure who comes first. Just that they’re shaking in each other’s arms now, gasping\ninto each other’s skin. \nSweat and heat and touch. \n \n*\n \nAfter, Cas bundles Dean toward the shower, shaky legs and all. \n“Could just mojo us clean again,” Dean mumbles, leaning against Cas as he tests the\ntemperature of the water with the underside of his wrist. Dean used to do that same thing with\nSammy’s bottle: a drop of milk to his skin, waiting to see if it would leave a red mark or wipe\naway like it was never there. \nCas seems satisfied with the heat level because he nods to himself absently, pulling the\ncurtain back and helping Dean inside. “Yes,” he says. He turns so that Dean is under the\nspray, hands on his waist. “But I’d like to wash you. Is that alright?”\nDean hadn’t really minded, had just been pointing something out mostly because his brain to\nmouth filter is shit after a good orgasm, but now it suddenly feels like the nicest thing\nanybody has ever wanted to do for him. He blinks fast and heavy, forcing back the feeling\nthat’s taking advantage of his weak defenses. He nods. \nCas smiles like it’s Dean doing him a favor. \n“Thank you,” Cas says quietly. He strokes away the strands of Dean’s hair already beginning\nto stick to his temples beneath the water, gentle and slow. \n\n“There you go, thanking me for things that I don’t even hafta work for,” Dean says. His heart\nbeats in his throat. He watches Cas flick the cap of one of the mini shampoo bottles this place\ncame stocked with, watches him squirt a dollop into his palm. Watches Cas watch him back.\n“Gonna give a guy a complex, Cas.”\nCas reaches up and begins to massage the shampoo through Dean’s hair, fingertips working\nlittle soothing circles into Dean’s scalp. Dean has to reach out and grip Cas’s hips; has to hold\nonto him so his knees don’t turn to liquid and send him toppling to the slippery floor. \n“You do have to work for it,” Cas says. He is cupping the back of Dean’s skull, right at the\nplace where tender flesh meets the top of his spine. Right at the place where Dean has been\ntaught to aim a killing blow. “You have to work to let yourself accept my care.”\nDean can feel how hot his face is, and it ain’t ‘cuz of the shower steam. He palms Cas’s wet-\nwarm hip again, looking at Cas’s winged collar bones because he can’t quite manage to look\nhim in the eye after that. \n“What can I say,” Dean says, trying on a grin. “I’m a masochist.” \n“No,” murmurs Cas. “I don’t think you are. I think you want somebody to be kind to you so\nbadly that you punish yourself for it.”\nIt’s quiet between them now. Just the beat of water pressure against the shower’s tile walls,\nand the fuzzy scrub of Cas’s fingertips through Dean’s hair. \nDean swallows tight. \n“Just relax, Dean,” Cas whispers to him, and drags his thumb beneath the hard crook of\nDean’s jaw, working out tension he didn’t even realize he was holding. Dean droops into him,\ninstinctual and subconscious, and Cas is right: he does have to work to let himself stay there.\n“Please just let me do this.”\nThere is water collected in droplets along the fan of Cas’s eyelashes, and there’s something\nlike yearning in the shape of his mouth. He misses his other Dean. This Dean can tell. \n“Ok, sweetheart,” Dean husks, and doesn’t miss the softening of Cas’s brow. He tucks a kiss\ninto Cas’s wrist as it passes him by. “Alright.”\nAnd Dean shouldn’t be tired—he slept a good three hours last night—but he gets so sleepy\nhere in the warm steam, lulled by Cas’s touch, that he finds himself nodding off as Cas works\nhis hands through Dean’s hair. It’s overwhelming to be touched like this, in the way that\nsuddenly being presented with a three course meal after months of starving overwhelms: it’s\ndizzying. So fulfilling that even while Dean is glutting himself on the feel of Cas’s touch,\nhe’s dreading the day that it’ll be taken away from him again. \n“It’s ok,” Cas tells him, so close, so quiet that it’s barely a breath. He kisses one of Dean’s\nclosed eyelids and then the other. His mouth is shower-wet. Velvet-soft. “It’s ok, Dean.”\nIt isn’t. But Dean can’t do anything to change that.\n\n \n*\n \n“Who’s Jack?”\nThey’re in the Impala, I-44 whipping by them with flat gray sameness, and Dean can’t stop\nstaring at Cas’s hand. \nIt sits in a careful curve along Cas’s thigh, half-open and waiting. Dean has wanted to reach\nacross and take it in his own since they piled into Baby an hour and a half ago, but something\nthat feels very much like a bottle smashed against the side of his face has been stopping him. \nSo he’s just looking. So he’s just hoping that Cas will realize, and take initiative. \nSo he’s distracting himself. \nIt seems to work, because Cas looks up at him with sky-blue eyes as wide as fists. “Jack?” he\nrepeats. There’s a drive to his voice, a sharpness that Dean’s only rarely heard, a pointed tip\nof sorrow that makes Dean think of how like Cas’s eyes Jack’s own had looked, wet with\nunshed tears. Slowly, awareness begins to trip its way down Dean’s spine. “Why? Did you\ndream of him?”\n“Dreamed of him, remembered him... saw him somehow, yeah.” Dean shifts his hands on the\nsteering wheel, an itch in his palms. He can’t tell by the way Cas is looking at him whether\nthis is good or bad, and it's making him brace for... something. Rejection, maybe, or anger.\n“Same way I’ve been seeing things since, uh. Since you got here.”\n“What did he say to you?” Cas demands. \nCas is staring at Dean like he can find answers written beneath his skin. \n“Said that it was working, whatever it is. And that he could feel someone, and I know this\ndon’t make sense, but I just knew that someone was you.” Dean thinks of the way Jack had\ncrossed to him. That slump in his shoulders. “He seemed real sad, Cas. I didn’t know who he\nwas at first, just knew I was supposed to... to comfort him, like it was my job to, the way I\nfeel about Sammy. So I reached out and took his hand. And then it was like earlier, when I\nknew he was talking about you: I knew he was Jack. And I knew I cared about him.” Dean\ndidn’t realize he was tearing up, but the road blurs in front of him now, bleeding out like a\nwatercolor painting. “He started to cry, Cas. Told me that he was trying. I think he—he really\nmisses you.”\nCas’s hand is gripping his thigh now, no longer open and facing Dean. “What did you say to\nhim?” he asks quietly. \nDean breathes in deep, lets it out slow. Slips Cas half a smile. “I said ‘me too.’”\nOne mile marker passes by them before Cas speaks again, and then another. \n\n“I can feel him, too,” he says quietly. “I dismissed it as too hopeful at first—I can’t tell you\nwhat led me here, but it was an inevitability, and seemingly an irreversible one at that—but\nthe longer I’m here, the stronger that feeling gets, and with the strengthening of my grace as\nwell... I can’t help but think that perhaps it isn’t entirely foolish of me to think you’re all\ndoing your best to reach me.”\nDean knows they are. Knows it like he knows his own name. \n“Can you tell me who Jack is?” he asks. \nHe can see that familiar hesitation in Cas’s eyes, that reluctance to tell Dean anything of their\nfuture together, and it stings like it does every time. He knows Cas is just doing it out of an\nurge to protect him, but it’s an urge Dean doesn’t understand: Dean is Dean, in any timeline,\nand he can take care of himself. \n“Please, Cas,” he asks. He pushes past that tangle of shame and fear and grips Cas’s hand,\nholding it tight. He already feels better. “You’re gonna have to wipe me anyway, man, you’ve\nsaid so yourself. Please.”\nCas sighs, and it doesn’t mean anything. He’s holding Dean’s hand too gently for it to mean\nanything. \n“Jack is our son,” Cas says finally.\nDean goes hot all over, and then cold, and only because he’s been driving since he was eleven\ndoes he not send them careening into the median. Still, he has to try three times before he can\nget his mouth to work. “He’s our what?”\nCas smiles at Dean faintly. “Our son. Mine and yours and Sam’s. He’s a nephilim. Not\nbiologically any of ours, but that doesn’t matter. He’s three years old, and he’s ours.”\nThere is so much to unpack in that statement and Dean feels all of it, battering against his\nbrain like a bull. Their son. Jesus Christ. What the hell. Future Dean can’t tell Cas he loves\nhim but they’re co-parenting a kid? A nephilim kid? With Sam?\nHe latches onto about the only thing he can wrap his head around right now. “Three?” he says\nweakly. “But he’s—he looked... old. Older than that. Just a little younger than Sammy is\nnow, maybe.”\n“Well, yes,” Cas says, and then he shrugs. “Jack was forced to age much more quickly than\nthe average child. In the physical sense, at least.”\nDean nods, because there’s nothing else he can possibly do to help himself process this\ninformation. Cas is stroking a comforting thumb over Dean’s knuckles, so Dean focuses on\nthat. Lets the touch ground him a little.\nHe’s got a kid. Sammy is all grown up and apparently likes Dean enough again to be a dad to\nthis kid, too, and Dean loves an angel and he loves Dean back, and the three of them are\nraising a speed-grown magic kid together. \n\nThey’re a family. Dean has a family. \nThat family wants Cas back. And Dean can’t even blame them. \n“I was sitting in a library,” Dean tells Cas. “There were books open all around me, and my\nspine hurt, like I’d been sitting there for a really long time.” He feels Cas’s eyes on the side\nof his face. That gaze like a touch. Dean thinks he’ll miss it when it’s gone, even if he can’t\nremember what it is he’s missing. Knows he will. “We’re trying to get you back, Cas. Of\ncourse we are.”\nCas doesn’t let go.\n \n*\n \nThere’s nobody in the gas station when Dean runs in to buy snacks, and he doesn’t hear\nanyone enter behind him, which is why he notices the two men standing at the end of the\naisle when he turns around. \nDean doesn’t hesitate. He drops his beef jerky and pulls his gun, cocking the trigger and\naiming at the man in front with one swift, steady movement. \n“Who the fuck are you?” Dean snarls. His heartbeat tastes like metal. \nAs quickly as Dean draws his gun, the man in front does too. “You know who we are,” he\nsays. He looks back at Dean with his own green eyes, lined with age and sharp with wild\ngrief, but identical. Unmistakable. His voice is low like a punch. “Now where’s my angel?”\nChapter End Notes\nsorry this is so late! life got swiftly insane for me these last few weeks, and since this\nchapter is such an emotional one, i decided it was more important to take my time with\nit and make it good rather than rush it and give ya’ll something half-assed. hopefully the\nwait wasn’t too bad!\nsix down one to go baby\n\nChapter 7\nChapter Summary\nJesus, Dean thinks, gripping his free hand into a fist. Jesus, do I look at him like that?\nChapter Notes\nSee the end of the chapter for notes\nThe cashier is making high pained noises behind the counter, sharp and wordless like a dog\ncaught in a trap. \nIt happens quickly. One moment Dean is staring down the barrel of a pistol held in another\npair of hands that look just like his; the next, that same pistol is being turned and tilted and\nslammed tenderly into the cashier’s temple, and he drops to the ground. \nDean can hear his own breath in his ears. Harsh and ragged. \n“Tell me something only we’d know,” Dean says. The second man is standing perfectly still\nwhere he’s been the whole time, and Dean wants desperately to look at him, Dean wants\ndesperately for him to be real—but he refuses to glance away from this other version of\nhimself. \nDean doesn’t like the way he looks. Other Dean. Dean doesn’t like the caustic laugh he gives\nat that order, or the way he wields his gun like he hates it more than the thing it’s pointed\ntoward. \n“Cherry,” says Other Dean after a minute, and stares at Dean with those tired eyes, lit with a\nsort of determination that seems to be the only thing keeping him on two feet. “Eighteenth\nbirthday. Lipstick. You’ve never told anybody.”\nHis voice scrapes out of him like it’s being forced. He sounds like he hasn’t spoken in\nweeks. \n“Lower your gun first,” Dean says finally, his own voice coming out forced-deep too, simply\non instinct. He’s trying to sound tough, he thinks; though Other Dean is the same height as\nhim, but Dean can’t help but feel tiny in his presence. Something insignificant standing in the\nway of his goal. “And then I’ll think about cooperating.”\nA muscle ticks in Other Dean’s jaw. “Tell me where the angel is,” he growls, “and I’ll think\nabout lowering my gun.”\nThe second man finally speaks. “Dean.”\n\nThey both look at him. Dean’s eyes flood with tears immediately, and he hates it, and there’s\nnot a thing he can do to make it stop. \nSam. It’s Sammy. \nHe looks the same as he had in Dean’s dream weeks ago, which is to say so different from the\nkid Dean watched walk away last year that he almost can’t breathe through it. He’s a fuckin’\ngiant still, towering a head and shoulders over both Deans, but where Dean’s Sam is still\nnothing but a slim-shouldered kid, this guy is broad. Strong-looking. Stands with his\nshoulders relaxed and curled a little inwards like he’s tipping down to hear everybody else,\nand his hands casually in his pockets like Dean’s Sam does, and his chin tilted down. His hair\nis longer than Dean’s ever seen it. His eyes are kind. \nDean doesn’t realize he’s lowered his gun until Other Dean lowers his own.\n“Sammy?” Dean breathes. Jesus, he sounds like a fucking kid, but—but god. God, it’s good\nto see him. “You—are you ok?”\n“Yeah.” Sam smiles at him so softly. It goes through Dean like a blade. “I’m ok, Dean.”\nHe’s not used to anything but pushback when he asks that question; not used to Sam letting\nDean look out for him without yelling that he can take care of himself, or telling Dean that\nhe’s not a baby, that he’s his own man, that he doesn’t need Dean breathing down the back of\nhis neck like he thinks he’s Dad. \nAnd Dean never needed any of that shit—he didn’t take care of Sammy because he wanted\nthanked for it, he took care of him because he’s his brother and he loves him and their\ngoddamn father was never gonna do it—but something about Sam acting like Dean wanting\nhim to be alright isn’t the worst thing in the world is just riding that edge of too much to take\nin. \nDean doesn’t let himself think about it. He steps forward and throws his arms around Sam’s\nshoulders, tugging him down close like he’s still that little kid Dean got to watch out for. \nSam hugs him back immediately. This, too, is a shock: the Winchesters ain’t huggers unless\nsomebody’s on death’s door, and even then they try to avoid it. \nBut Sam sinks into Dean like he wants to be there, like he wants his big brother to just hold\nhim for a sec. \nDean blinks hard and fast, forcing his tears back. He cuffs Sam on the back of the head, soft,\nand then just leaves his palm there. \n“Shit,” Dean says shakily. “ Shit I miss you.”\nHe can see Other Dean over Sam’s shoulder. He can see the stutter of his eyelids when he\nblinks, and the flex of his throat when he swallows. He can see the hollows beneath his\ncheekbones. That shadows beneath his eyes. \n\n“I’m at school, right?” Sam asks him as he draws back. Dean’s hand falls to the nape of his\nneck, and he gives it one last bracing squeeze before he steps away, too. “How long’s it been\nsince we’ve seen each other?”\n“‘Bout eight months,” Dean says. He doesn’t tell Sam that he feels each of those months like\na wound. “You texted me on my birthday.”\nSam nods. He looks like he’s going to say something, a wrinkle between his brows, but then\nthe front door opens and they all three turn. \nIt’s Cas.\n“Dean?” he calls, stepping inside and letting the door slam behind him. When he sees the\ncashier in a heap behind the counter he comes up short, whipping his gaze around the station\nwith a frown. “Where...”\nDean sees the exact moment Cas spots Other Dean. Can read it on his face like a book. \nHis face goes pale, and his eyes go wide. He starts to run at the same moment Other Dean\ndoes. \nThey crash into each other in the middle of the store, knocking into a display of beef jerky\nand sending its contents rattling to the ground as Cas catches Other Dean up in his arms, as\nOther Dean sinks into him like he needs him to breathe. Cas has handfuls of Other Dean’s\njacket wound up in his fists; Other Dean is curled over himself like his spine is made of\nsomething brittle, forcing himself into as small a shape as he can go in order to tuck his face\ninto Cas’s neck and be enveloped by him. \nOther Dean is completely silent, but Dean can see from here the way he shakes. Like he’s\nfalling to pieces where he stands. \n“Dean,” Cas murmurs into Other Dean’s hair, his eyes shut, one hand coming free to run\ngentle trails up the length of that breakable spine. He says that name the way he always does\n—like there’s no other word he’d rather house on his tongue—but the fact that it isn’t\ndirected at Dean stings. “Dean—it’s alright. It’s ok.”\nIt’s all so—Dean doesn’t know what to do, where to look, if it’s wrong to hate the fact that\nCas is being so loving with another person when that person is technically Dean. Is he really\nso stupid that he’s jealous of himself?\nDean watches Cas drop a kiss into the fine hairs of Other Dean’s temple and thinks, yeah. \n“I love you,” Other Dean says finally, muffled into Cas’s neck, and he sounds wrecked: his\nvoice is softer than it had been earlier, but in a way that’s broken down, a way that’s been\npummeled and bruised like the skin of a peach. It cracks in the middle. A chasm. “You\nasshole, you dumb, stupid, self-sacrificing asshole—I love you, too. Of course I do.”\nCas’s smile is tragic. He takes Other Dean’s cheek in his hand, draws his face up from its\nhidden place. He looks at him for a moment with that long gaze. And then he kisses him. \n\nDean thinks of that bar back in South Dakota. Kissing that woman—Candace—and looking\nup to see Cas watching him do it. \nOther Dean shudders and then sways into him, hands losing their claw-like grip on Cas’s\nbiceps to skate up his shoulders, his neck, to come to rest at the stubbled sharpness of Cas’s\njaw. There’s no other word for what he’s doing: he’s cradling Cas. He holds him desperately. \n“You found me,” Cas murmurs, threading his fingers through the hair at the nape of Other\nDean’s neck. They’re swaying a little in the center of the gas station, a man bleeding on the\nfloor to the side of them, two other people looking on. Dean gets it. When Cas looks at you,\nit’s easy to forget anybody else exists. “You really did it.”\nSam steps forward now, and then it’s just Dean hanging back, Dean watching this reunion\nscene with his heart still lodged in his mouth. \n“It was mostly Jack,” Sam says. When Cas looks at him Sam opens his arms with a smile,\nand Cas steps into them, hugging Sam with considerably less passion but no less relief than\nhe’d embraced Other Dean with. Other Dean is watching, eyes fixed on Cas like he could\nfade from existence if Other Dean looks away. “He—well. We can explain it all later.”\n“I’d sort of like to know,” Dean says. “Seeing as you all were in my damn head.”\nHis voice sounds way too loud, blistering the tenderness of the reunion to which he bears\nwitness. They all look at him, like resurfacing from a daze: sharp. They’d forgotten he was\neven there. \nDean is still holding his gun. \n“You can put your weapon away, Dean,” Cas tells him, a hand half-stretched his way as if to\ntouch him. As if he could reach around the collapsed shelf, the body, the two men on either\nside of him, the blood smeared across chipped linoleum. “It’s really them. I can tell.”\nCas’s eyes have caught on his, and they stick, and they stay. Dean wants to cross to him and\nnestle himself between Cas’s arms like Other Dean had done, a mean, perverse little twist\ndown in the core of him longing to show that Cas is his, that he belongs to the Dean he is\nright now as much as Dean belongs to him—but something stops him in his tracks. \nIt’s joy that lights Cas’s eyes from within like that. It’s unfettered joy with which he’s holding\nOther Dean’s hand, all gentle-like, fingers folded over Other Dean’s knuckles as if they aren’t\nscarred and torn and bruised. \nThe sorrow that has haunted Cas since he and Dean met is gone. Dean’s never seen him this\nhappy, and he is unbearably beautiful with it. \nDean knows it’s really Sammy and Other Dean here. His throat is dry. He asks anyway. \n“How d’you know?”\nCas’s whole face softens. This morning, when he’d looked at Dean like that, he’d kissed\nhim. \n\nHe says simply, “Your soul.”\nOther Dean’s gaze skips to Cas like a stone across a pond, and where it had been so heavy\nlooking at Dean a few minutes ago, deadened, now it’s... it’s so vulnerable that Dean almost\nfeels like he shouldn’t be allowed to see it. \nAnd Jesus, Dean thinks, gripping his free hand into a fist. Jesus, do I look at him like that? \n“Our souls still look the same?” Other Dean asks Cas. His voice still sounds like it had when\nhe’d confessed to Cas, all rough and soft and exhausted, edges folding in on themselves. His\nown hand has a death-grip on Cas’s. “Even after... everything?”\nEverything. Dean thinks of what Cas had said: that they meet while Dean’s going through\nsome sort of great pain. Dean wonders if he can somehow get Other Dean to tell him what\nthat means. Dean wonders if he even wants to. \n“Of course,” Cas murmurs. “Dean, you’re still you no matter what time you’re from. You\nare... ineffable.”\nIt’s trippy as hell to watch his own face go dusky red like that; to watch his own lids lower in\na gesture weirdly bashful for such a hardened man, and watch the half-baked shrug of his\nshoulders as he tries to slough the compliment off, and watch the way he tilts into Cas\nanyway, shameless, seeking him like he’s sunlight. “Well that ain’t true,” Other Dean\nmumbles. \n“Hm,” says Cas. He’s smiling. He can tell Dean’s eating those words up like candy—shit,\neven Sammy can, if his own grin is anything to go buy. “I believe that I’ll be the judge.”\nDean tucks his gun away. \nOnly Sam seems to notice. He nods at Dean, quietly communicated acknowledgement of\nwhat that gesture means—’cuz even if he doesn’t get the way Dean’s chest aches when he\nsees Cas treating someone else like that, he surely gets the lengths Dean has to go to trust\nanyone. They were both raised—if you can call it that—by the same man. They both have a\nthick layer of fear mongering built up beneath their skin. \n“Why don’t we go somewhere else to talk about everything?” Sam says. “Jack is gonna bring\nus back in three hours, because we thought it might take a while to find Cas, so we’ve got\nsome time.” He glances at the cashier on the floor. “I’d hate for this guy to wake up and\nwe’re still here.”\nThree hours. That’s all Dean’s got left with him. \n“Of course,” Cas says. He lets go of Other Dean to cross behind the counter; Other Dean’s\nhand flexes at the loss of Cas’s touch, eyes pinned to him as Cas kneels on the dirty floor,\ncoat pooling behind him, and places two fingers above the man’s wounded forehead. \nIt’s different from the way Cas had healed Dean in that motel room after his dream, warm\nand close and careful with his hands curved over Dean’s skin. He doesn’t touch this man at\n\nall: simply concentrates for half a moment, blue eyes flaring brightly as his grace flows into\nthe man’s bleeding skull. \nThere is a snap of ozone, bright and clear and intoxicating on Dean’s tongue. The wound\nclears up instantly. Cas rises, and the glow of his eyes fades. \n“My grace,” he says, looking to Other Dean and Sam. “It’s stronger than it’s been in years.”\n“Yeah,” Other Dean says. He’s stepped in close to Cas again so that their shoulders just\nbarely brush, his whole being so obviously drifting toward Cas that Dean would roll his eyes\nif he didn’t know he does the same damn thing. He’s not sure Other Dean realizes it’s\nhappening. It gives him a strange sort of satisfaction to have something he doesn’t, even if\nit’s just a bit of embarrassing self-awareness. “Well, we can talk about that too.”\nThey clean up the gas station as best they can, both Deans righting shelves and picking up\nscattered product, Sammy propping the still-sleeping cashier up against the wall as\ncomfortably as he can manage, Cas clearing away any lingering bloodstains with a flick of\nhis fingers. \nDean’s real grateful that this stretch of Oklahoma is as barren as it is: he can’t imagine having\nto explain this scene to somebody if they happened to wander in. \nAs they step out the door Cas touches Dean, fingers grazing the stretch of arm from his elbow\nto his wrist, and Dean has to stop for a moment. Has to waver there in the doorway, breath\ngone tight and flighty in his chest. \nCas is looking at him. Looking, looking, in the way that makes Dean feel shucked bare. \n“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas asks quietly.\nDean says, “Yeah, Cas. Yeah.” And Dean swallows the hunger down.  \n \n*\n \nThere is a moment, standing beneath the wide gray sky, where both Deans reach for Baby’s\ndriver side door. \nDean arches an eyebrow at his older self, feeling that itch that always springs to his veins\nwhen there’s too much going on around him and just needs to hit something to settle himself\ndown. \n“Easy, cowboy,” Dean drawls, and tosses Baby’s keys into the air just to catch them while\nOther Dean looks on. “Ain’t your car yet.”\n“Ain’t your car yet either, kid,” Other Dean snaps. He’s got a look on his face that Dean\nknows well: a little mean, a little helpless, knowing that he’s gotta say something that cuts to\n\nthe soft underbelly of his opponent or risk revealing his own. “Still belongs to John, far as I\nremember.”\nCas, who has been watching this exchange with a frown that Dean can’t quite interpret, goes\non ahead and lets his face darken at the mention of John. At the way Dean goes a little stiff\nhearing his name said so soon after what went down a day ago. \n“You see him anywhere?” Dean asks before Cas can say anything, sweeping an arm out wide\nto encompass the whole of what stands around them: the cracked pavement lot, the pump\nBaby’s pulled up against, the fields that roll fallow beyond the station, winter-yellow poking\nup from beneath dirty snow. It’s just them standing here. Just them and the lonely highway. \nOther Dean doesn’t answer. Sam rolls his eyes at both of them. Cas tucks his hand up against\nthe dip of Other Dean’s lower back and guides him into the back seat, murmuring something\nthat Dean can’t hear. \n“Didn’t think so,” Dean says. He climbs into the front seat, slamming the door behind him. \nFor a good long while they ride in silence, thick and steeped in more emotions than Dean can\neven name. \nCas has his arm around Other Dean. Other Dean, who is an inch or so taller than Cas but\ncertainly not more broad, is tilting toward Cas like he wants to burrow into him, like he—like\nhe wants to live there, fuse his cells with Cas’s, not have to bother with existing as two\nseparate beings. Dean gets it. Dean gets it. \nHe holds the wheel tight, forces his eyes back to the road. \nThe thing is... the Dean back there is the Dean up here, just later on. So Dean doesn’t need to\nfeel this hollow ring of abandonment, so it is—it’s stupid of him to, actually, because he gets\nto have everything Other Dean gets to have eventually. Technically the man experiencing\nboth of these sensations—the euphoria of even Cas’s simplest touch, and something that\ntastes too much like loneliness—is the same man. Dean is allowed to have this. Dean is\nallowed to want it, and that want is gonna be fulfilled. \nIt’s just that Dean wants it now. He doesn’t want to wait until he’s old. He doesn’t want to\nforget Cas. \nHe pulls off at a Waffle House that sits on the side of the interstate like a gargoyle without\nbeing asked, parking in the mostly-empty lot and killing the engine. Nobody objects so he\nfigures this is as good a place to talk about traveling through time as any: a Waffle House at\nthree pm, sat alone on a stretch of highway that’s looked the same for the past thirty miles. \nDean goes to get out but Sam stops him, a hand on Dean’s forearm. \n“You guys go ahead and get us a table,” Sam says, turning halfway so his arm runs along the\nlength of Baby’s front seat and meeting Cas and Other Dean’s eyes. “We’ll be just a sec.”\n\nOther Dean looks askance, gaze darting quickly between Sam and Dean, but he doesn’t say\nanything. Just sits still with his jaw too tight, halfway turned toward Cas like he’s been since\nthey got in the car. \n“I will order us all coffees,” Cas says. It’s one of those charming things he says, on the verge\nof being awkward but so earnest that it can’t quite manage, and it’s on instinct that Dean\nmeets his eyes in the rearview mirror and smiles.\n“Thanks, Cas,” he says fondly. \nCas smiles back at him. His small one, his quiet one, the one that feels like something special\ntipped gently into the cup of Dean’s outstretched palms. \nOther Dean stiffens slightly in Dean’s peripheral, his mouth a tight pale line. \nDean and Sam watch the two of them cross the parking lot, the backs of their hands touching,\ntheir shoulders brushing with each step. Other Dean holds the door for Cas, and Cas stays\nclose to him as they walk through. \nAnd then it’s just them. Just Sam and Dean. \nIf he was given a thousand tries, Dean doesn’t think he would be able to explain the way\nlooking at this Sammy makes him feel. There is pride coursing through him—pride at the\nenduring kindness in Sam’s words and in his eyes, pride at the absence of bitter anger that’s\nfueled Sammy since he was a kid and first learned how bad their lives were, pride at the fact\nthat he’s still living, breathing, existing—but Dean can’t deny a low, dull twist of sadness. \nThis must be how parents feel, Dean thinks, when they send their kid away to school.\nBecause the kid might come back, but they aren’t gonna need you anymore. \n“Sammy,” says Dean, cutting in soft before Sam can say anything. There is something else\nhere too, brewing in that swill of emotions coursing through him. A guilt so sour he can taste\nit. “I’m sorry.”\nSam clearly hadn’t expected that. Dean gets it: Dean’s never been big on apologies. He tries\nnot to wince. \n“I dunno what happens between us,” Dean says. He’s staring at his own hands because he\ncan’t look at Sam while he says this: the points of his knuckles, the lines in his palms. “Cas\nsays I can’t know ‘cuz it’ll mess up our timelines or something, and I’m not gonna fight him\non it. I just know that whatever I fuck up to get you back in the life, I’m sorry, and if I could\nremember any of this after you all go home, I would leave you alone and let you be happy\nlike you always wanted.”\nDean hates the catch in the back of his throat, and the tremble running down his wrists. Dean\nhates the silence that sits heavy between them after he’s done.\nBut this older Sam is gentler, too. A little slower, a little more thoughtful. When he reaches\nout and grips Dean’s shoulder, searching for Dean’s gaze and finding it, Dean almost can’t\n\nbear it. \n“Dean, listen to me,” Sam says. “I’m—the Sam you know right now is an angry, angry kid.\nHe’s so blinded by the hate he feels for the life he was forced to live that he’s cutting himself\noff completely from the only good constant he’s ever had: you.” Sam smiles sadly at him, his\neyebrows tugged up in the middle, as Dean tries to take a deep breath. “I don’t hate you now\nand I never hated you then, no matter what it might feel like. I’m grateful you come find me,\neven if the circumstances suck—and they do. You raised me, Dean. You’re my big brother\nand you’re my best friend, and there’s nobody I look up to more than you. Don’t apologize.\nNot for this.”\nDean hugs Sam again. He’s never hugged him twice in one day, not since they were little\nkids, but sue him. He’s gotta say goodbye soon anyway.\nSam lets Dean wrap him up in his arms, going easily where Dean tugs him. “Whatever you\nsay, bitch,” Dean mumbles into Sam’s shoulder, voice thick with tears that he refuses to let\nfall. \nSam laughs. Dean appreciates that it’s a little teary, too. “Jerk,” he says fondly. \nThey stay like that for a while. When Dean pulls back Sam’s eyes are red so Dean laughs\nloudly, needing to gain back at least a bit of his dignity. \nSam sighs at him. It doesn't escape Dean’s notice that he’s smiling anyway. \n \n*\n \nInside, Cas and Other Dean are sitting on the same side of the booth, shoulders pressed\ntogether. \nThey aren’t even speaking, and they don’t have to. Other Dean is sipping his coffee slowly,\neyes closed; he’s leaning into Cas, something disarmingly fragile in the way he’s trusting Cas\nto be there for him, steady and assured. They’re holding hands on the tabletop between them\nand Cas is staring at Other Dean’s profile like he can’t believe he’s real. \nThey’re just existing together. Dean would hate to interrupt them if he wasn’t a jealous\nbastard. \nHe and Sam slide in on the opposite side of the booth, Sam across from Other Dean and Dean\nacross from Cas. Dean dives for his own coffee and takes a long drink, telling himself that it\nabsolutely isn’t the case that he’s avoiding Cas’s gaze. \nOther Dean opens his eyes when he hears them, taking the two of them in with a raised brow.\n“You guys talk it out?” \nSam just rolls his eyes. “Sure, Dean,” he says.\n\nBeneath the table, Cas touches Dean’s foot with his. \nNothing crazy. Just a little nudge, his shoe fitted up alongside Dean’s boot, casual enough\nthat it could be played off as an accident if Dean didn’t jerk his head up to look at Cas\nimmediately and see the barren, measured focus of his gaze turned right Dean’s way. \nHe wants to say something. He wants to reach across the table and take Cas’s hands. He\nwants to go back to this morning when they were curled up in bed together, nothing but the\nbeat of their hearts, the whisper of their breath, the safety of their mutual touch. \nThey order—well, Dean and Other Dean do: Cas and Sam stick with coffee—and everybody\nacts like they don’t see the weird looks both Deans are getting from the waitress. She makes\nit quick at their table, maybe sensing the weird tension radiating off all of them; she tucks her\nnotepad away and promises to have their food out ASAP, and then she’s gone. \nThey’re alone in here, or mostly. There’s a man with a trucker cap slung low over his eyes at\nthe countertop, but that’s it. Still, Dean keeps his voice quiet as he goes to speak.\n“Alright,” he says. “Spill.” \nOther Dean glances at Sam. Shrugs, as if to say you first. \n“Right,” Sam says. “Well, like I said it was mostly Jack. Dean, I don’t know if you know who\nJack is—”\n“I do,” Dean says. Cas’s foot is still touching his. “Cas told me.”\nSam nods. “After you got taken, Cas—and after we defeated Chuck, which we don’t really\nhave time to get into right now—we tried everything we could to get you back. Every ritual\nwe could think of, every spell. Nothing worked. Jack kept trying to sense your grace but\neither it was too faint to feel, or you were just too far away.”\nCas nods slowly. “I believe that if I had gone where I was supposed to, Jack could have felt\nme easily. He did the first time, after all.”\n“That’s what we figured,” Other Dean says. The hand that Cas isn’t holding plays restlessly\nwith a loose sugar packet, flipping it across his knuckles over and over again; Dean frowns to\ncatch himself fiddling with his jacket cuff the same way. “We thought... um. Thought you\nwere dead at first.” He squeezes Cas’s hand tight, eyes staring someplace none of the rest of\nthem can see. “Almost lost hope.”\nDean is watching Cas stroke his thumb over Other Dean’s knuckles. Soothing over the ridges\nand valleys of bone.\n“Luckily Jack managed to catch a flicker of something that felt like you eventually,” Sam\nsays. “We were all confused when he realized it was in a different fold of time—shit, I still\ndon’t really know how he could tell—but he singled it out anyway. He said he could probably\nonly feel you because you were so different from everything around you. Present day you in\nthe past.” Sam smiles a little, though Dean doesn’t miss the way his glance flicks his\n\ndirection at these next words. “He got most of Chuck’s powers after... everything. But he’s\nusing them for good this time.”\nDean has no idea who this Chuck guy is and he’s pretty sure nobody’s gonna tell him, but\nhe’s still unreasonably proud of Jack. Even if he doesn’t know him yet. \nLooks like Cas is, too. “I’m sure he is,” Cas says, and smiles. “It’s incredibly impressive that\nhe was able to do what he did.”\n“Sure is,” Other Dean says. “Especially when he was able to pick up on me with you, since I\ndon’t got grace.”\nDean thinks of what Cas told him that first night he had healed him, staring at Dean so\ntenderly across a creaky motel bed: that an angel’s grace is the closest thing to a human’s soul\nthey have. \nDean doesn’t think they’re so different at all. \n“Cas told me my soul was real loud,” Dean says. “Maybe Jack can hear it too.”\n“Probably,” Other Dean says. It’s the first time he’s spoken directly to Dean since the gas\nstation, and while he’s still kinda gruff, he doesn’t seem as angry as he did earlier. \nIt’s still too strange to look at him too long. Dean sips his coffee again, even though the\naction is an obvious excuse. \n“In any case,” Sam says, “Jack started to try... well, a couple of things. He started out with\nthe grace first: sort of funneling it toward Cas across time, hoping that Cas’s grace would\npick up on it and merge with it easily. He thought that if Cas got to be powerful enough he\ncould time travel like angels have always been able to, and come home.”\nOther Dean has been shaking his head at this last sentence, gaze on Cas as usual. “I knew you\nwouldn’t do that,” he says quietly. Cas watches him, the shape of his eyes soft. “You’re as big\na martyr as I like to pretend to be. Knew you’d never come back to us on your own, because\nyou made a deal, and you believe in holding up your end of a bargain.”\nCas is doing that thing he does where he takes in every inch of a person’s face in small,\nthorough looks, leaving no part of Other Dean unbeheld. The corner of his mouth lifts,\nthough it’s sad in a way Dean doesn’t have the knowledge to understand. \n“You think too highly of me,” Cas says quietly. “I find that there’s very little I wouldn’t do in\norder to come back to you.”\nFace burning, Dean glances at Sam expecting to see him equally uncomfortable, and doesn’t\nfind what he’s looking for. \nSam seems almost... revlieved. Seems invested in the relationship between Other Dean and\nCas, in a way he’s never been with any of Dean’s relationships before. He wants them to be\nhappy. He wants them to be happy with each other. \n\nThe fact that Dean will eventually get his little brother’s wholehearted support in a\nrelationship he has with another man nearly bowls Dean over. \nHe half-misses Sam’s next words, too caught up in the race of his own thoughts. \n“...was also trying to bring Dean to the future at the same time. We couldn’t pinpoint exactly\nwhat year you two were in, so Jack couldn’t risk stopping off at each year of Dean’s life just\nto try and find you guys—who knows what that could’ve messed up. By trying to bring you\nto our timeline, Dean, Jack thought that you could tell us when in time you’re from, and then\nwe could all travel back to your year and get Cas.”\nIt’s all so fucking complicated, and Dean’s sure he looks like an idiot sitting here trying to\ntake it all in. Six months ago he didn’t believe angels existed, let alone time travel; now he’s\nsitting at a table with future versions of his brother and himself and the man he’s in love with\ngetting ready to lose them all again. \n“Why didn’t that work, then?” he asks, nodding his thanks when the waitress delivers his and\nOther Dean’s food. Dean shouldn’t have ordered anything. His stomach’s got a pit in it,\nhollow and roiling, and there’s nothing he can do to fill it. \n“You said we were in your head,” Other Dean says. It’s not an answer. Dean notices that he\nhasn’t picked up his fork, either. “What do you mean by that?”\nDean shifts where he sits, thinking. He hasn’t had to explian this to anybody but Cas, and it\nwas hard enough to put into words then. \nAlthough if anybody’s gonna understand him, it’s going to be these guys. \n“I kept having... dreams, I’ll call them, ‘cuz they happened when I was asleep.” He hesitates,\nand then he meets Other Dean’s eyes. “I was you, I think. Like I was experiencing what was\nhappening to you. I was sitting in a cement room for the first couple, and it was cold, and I\nwas—the only time I’ve ever felt somethin’ like that was when Mom died. Like there was a\npart of me that had been ripped away. Just... gone.” He has to swallow once, and then twice,\nhis throat thick. “I knew it was ‘cuz Cas got taken. Was all I could think about.”\nThe table has gone quiet around him. Dean can’t look at Cas. Other Dean’s eyes are red, but\nhe nods stiffly. \n“Yeah,” he rasps. “Uh, similar thing happened to me. Except. Except it was like I was you.\nLike I’d be sitting there in Baby and I’d glance over and Cas was with me, singin’ along to\nthe radio while I drove through a town I haven’t been to in fifteen years. I thought they were\ndreams at first too, because I knew I’d—I knew there was no fucking way I could forget\nsomething like that. Just bein’ happy with him.”\nOther Dean doesn’t say it, but Dean can tell: those dreams probably upset him as much as\nDean’s did his. While Dean was waking up knowing what it was like to have Cas ripped\naway, Other Dean was waking up having to remember that that was his actual reality. \n\n“So we... what, so we switched places?” Dean asks, though even as he’s saying it he doesn’t\nthink it’s true. The dreams were all so brief, and not quite tangible enough to be reality. It was\nmore like they switched memories. Sensations. \n“Maybe,” Sam says doubtfully, frowning that way he does when he can’t quite work\nsomething out. “I think Jack would have been able to tell though...”\n“I think it was the grace,” Cas says.\nEven Sam looks surprised at that. \n“I wasn’t aware while it was happening,” Cas says, tipping his head slightly. He’s thinking.\nDean watches the slow flutter of his lashes, the delicate furrow in his brow. “Though now I\nbelieve I see the signs. Angels can manipulate dreams, you know. I’ve visited Dean in his\nbefore, and shown him things that are both true and simply fabrications. It wouldn’t surprise\nme if Jack, in trying to send me grace and bring Dean to the future at the same time, got his\n‘wires crossed.’ Let some of the grace into Dean, so to speak.” \nDean’s chest feels tight. “Showed me the truth.”\nCas meets his eyes across the table, as gentle and as unyielding as a summer storm. “Yes,” he\nsays. He shifts his foot against Dean’s, tapping his ankle lightly. Tap. Tap. “Both versions of\nyou.”\nIt sounds crazy. But it all sounds crazy. \n“We finally found you two when Cas’s grace flared, bigger and brighter than it had been\nsince he got taken. Jack was able to feel it across decades,” Sam says. He looks from Dean to\nCas quickly, but Dean can tell he’s putting things together in that big brain of his. “He said to\nhave felt your grace that purely you must’ve been outside of your vessel, Cas.”\n“Yes,” Cas says simply. \nA moment of silence, in which Cas doesn’t elaborate. “Ok then,” Other Dean says. \nThere’s been a tight knot of fear in Dean’s chest for a while now, and it loosens when Cas\ndoesn’t mention John. He thinks he might shake apart if Cas did. \n“Jack’s bringing us back soon,” says Other Dean to Cas in that low tangle of a voice. “He\nsaid he had to bring us back in three hours whether or not we found you, but then we were\ngonna try again.”\nCas has not let go of his hand this whole time. He still doesn’t. He says, “I know you were.”\n \n*\n \n\nOther Dean sets a heavy palm on Dean’s shoulder as they’re heading toward the door. \nDean looks at him. \nHe jerks his head back toward the booth. “A word?”\nSam hasn’t noticed, but from the doorway, Cas meets Dean’s eyes. He nods once, slight, and\nthen he leaves too. \nDean thinks about saying something shitty, just to get under his older self’s skin—but\nsomething stops him. The way they stand eye-to-eye, maybe. The fact that he still looks dead\non his feet, even after getting Cas back. \n“Sure man,” Dean says. \nThey sit down on opposite sides of the table \nThey watch each other for a moment. \nIdentical posture and identical eyes and identical frowns. \nBut different, too. Other Dean is bulkier than Dean across the shoulders and the chest, and the\ncut of his jaw is almost gaunt-looking in the yellow light, a combination of his baby fat long\ngone and the kind of hollowness that Dean well knows comes with grief. He’s got more scars\nthan Dean has. Wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and between his brows. His right leg is\nstretched out stiffly beneath the table like it was injured a long time ago and never really\nhealed right, and there is tension, there is... there is defensiveness in the way he sits and\nstands and moves that Dean just doesn’t possess. \nAlways on the lookout. Always expecting to be attacked from any corner. \n“You love him,” Other Dean says.  \n“Of course I do,” Dean answers, but no sound comes out. \nOther Dean nods again. It’s a softer movement than his earlier gesture, heavy with\nunderstanding. His tongue darts across his lips and wets them before he speaks, a nervous\nhabit that Dean recognizes as his own. \n“He loves us, too,” Other Dean says. On his voice these words sound harsher than anything\nhe’s said yet, in a way that sinks itself into the soft meat of Dean’s heart. “He—he—he is the\nbest thing that ever happens to us.”\nDean feels unsteady, shaky inside. He says, “I know.”\nOther Dean watches him for a good long while. Dean gives back as good as he gets. \n“Do you know he saves your life?”\n\n“Already has,” Dean says. He thinks of the brilliant beautiful safety of Cas’s trueform. He\nthinks of Cas healing his ribs. He thinks of Cas showing up one cold night when Dean’s own\nloneliness had been threatening to eat him alive, not flinching even when Dean pulled a gun\non him, looking at Dean like he longed for him even though Dean was standing right there.\n“So I ain’t surprised.”\nOther Dean smiles slightly. It isn’t a smile for Dean. \n“He’s gonna wipe my memory,” Dean says—and his voice does shake now, but he doesn’t\nbother to hide it. Why should he? This is nothing more than talking to a mirror. “Will you tell\nme how I meet him?”\nOther Dean breathes in. Breathes out. \n“He pulls you outta Hell.”\nDean should be shocked by that, maybe. He can’t quite muster up the feeling. \n“Is it my fault I’m down there?” he asks—and he hates, hates, hates the tears in his eyes.\nHates the fear that turns his gut sour. “Do I fuck something up?”\n“No,” Other Dean says, so fiercely that it startles Dean. “It isn’t your fault, and you would do\nit a thousand times again.”\nThere is another question forcing its way onto Dean’s tongue. He makes it small. \n“Do I do it for John?”\nOther Dean closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them, they’re sad. “No,” he\nrepeats. Lower this time. “He isn’t around to control you anymore by then.”\nDean knows the relief he feels is broadcasted all over his face, and what’s more, he knows it’s\nshameful. But he can’t stop it. He doesn’t want to stop it.  \n“Look,” Other Dean says after a moment. He leans forward across the table, vinyl creaking\nbeneath him, and doesn’t break their gaze. “I know... I know what John’s like. I remember.\nAll that stuff he put on us as kids, and the way he wanted you and I to be a mother and a\nsolider and a gun at the same time... I know what a piece of shit he is. He hurt you growing\nup right? Kicked you around some? Told you learnin’ to take a beating was part of growing\ninto a real man?”\nDean can only nod, throat gone dry and wordless. If Other Dean were anybody else—maybe\neven Cas—Dean would fight a little, try to argue that John was making the best he could of a\nshitty situation, that he is a military man and don’t know any different. \nBut this isn’t anybody else. This is his future self, and only he can know so intimately what\nit’s like be John Winchester’s oldest son. \n“He’s wrong,” Other Dean says flatly. He ducks down to meet Dean’s gaze again when he\ntries to look away, forcing him to keep eye contact, and Dean breathes through the tightness\n\nof his lungs. “Every time he hit you when a hunt went wrong or when Sammy cried too hard,\nand those names he calls people who are different from him. He’s wrong about all of it.”\nOther Dean’s eyes are wet. Dean hates that, too. Dean can’t look away from him. “He’ll tell\nyou there’s only one way to be a man, a soldier—that you gotta kill anything that’s different,\nand sleep with any woman you meet, and never ask for help from nobody—and that fucks\nyou up. I still haven’t worked through that crap. I couldn’t tell Cas I loved him for twelve\nyears with the way that shame John dosed me with ate me up inside. Hell, I was still tryin’ to\ntell myself I liked sleeping with women for almost that long. \n“I know—I know I ain’t good at speeches, or saying shit that matters,” Other Dean continues\nquietly. “And I know you might not listen to a word I’m saying, because we’re Dean\nWinchester, and there’s nobody Dean Winchester has less faith in than himself. But kid, I\nhope you think about it. Because there’s—there’s more to this sorry world than the blood that\npoisons you. You got a family that loves you waiting for you here in the future, hard as that is\nto believe. You got Sammy, and Jack, and... and Cas.” He swallows, tight. When he speaks\nof his family, of Cas, his tired eyes go soft. “Yeah, you’re loved. And you’re loved ‘cuz of\nwho you really are, not ‘cuz of that person John tried to force you to be. You’re your own\nman. And you’re... you’re a better man than him. You are.”\nEven Other Dean looks almost stunned at the admission. His chest moves too fast beneath his\nflannel, like he’s just run a mile. \nDean doesn’t know what to say. \nIt’s all almost too much. Everything he’s ever wanted, sure—but still too much. And it isn’t a\nsmall part of his brain which tells him he doesn’t deserve it. \nBut then he looks at this man before him. His strong hands and the love in his eyes and the\nweariness he bears upon his shoulders like a yoke. \nMaybe there is a future where Dean deserves goodness. Love. A family who will stick\naround. \nMaybe that future is closer than he thinks. \n \n*\n \nSammy says to pull over a few miles down the highway, in a field covered in snow half\nturned to slush. \nThey all get out of the car. It feels too small in there, it feels—it feels cooped up. It feels like\nthe air’s so thick Dean’s about to drown. \nTen minutes until Jack takes them all back. \n\nDean leans against Baby’s door with his hands shoved deep in his jacket pockets, hoping it\nisn’t obvious the way he shakes. Hoping it isn’t obvious the way he stares at Cas, who is\nstanding so close to Other Dean that they must be able to feel each other’s breath. \nHe hears Sam’s footfalls crunching the ground next to him. He doesn’t look up. \nSam is silent for a while. Above them, a hawk cries one long, lonely shriek. \n“I’m sorry we have to leave,” Sam says finally. \nDean sniffs. The wind is making his eyes sting. “Not your fault, kid.”\n“No,” Sam agrees. He brushes Dean’s shoulder with his. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not\nsorry.”\nEight minutes. \n“Take care of yourself,” Dean says. “Ok Sammy? Please?”\n“Always do,” Sam says, and there’s a smile in his voice so Dean looks up at him. His\nlaughter lines, the hair he’s finally grown into, the body that Dean has taken on as his mission\nto feed and watch out for and make sure gets enough sleep. All these years between them that\nDean hasn’t gotten to see. “But in case I drop the ball, I’ve got you for that.”\nDean can’t speak. He punches Sam’s shoulder affectionately, and then he has to walk away. \nHis eyes are on his boots so he doesn’t realize he’s walked up next to Cas until he feels him.\nThe incredible sunbeam heat of him, all along Dean’s side. \nThey’re standing a foot apart but it doesn’t matter. Dean stares at him, at his eyes as blue as\nthe midwinter sky, and Cas stares back. \nDistantly, Dean takes note of Other Dean moving away. \n“Dean,” Cas whispers. \nFive minutes.\nThe tension that has existed on the surface of this day since Sam and Other Dean showed up\nsnaps now, folds in like a house of cards. Dean crashes himself into Cas’s arms. \nCas squeezes Dean so tightly around the ribs that his breath billows out of him, and he clings\nto Cas’s coat, and he doesn’t care. Cas feels so safe, like a home that Dean’s never known,\nand he smells like ozone and the inside of the Impala and a thunderstorm—and he holds\nDean, holds him tight, with his cheek pressed to Dean’s hair. \nFor a long time they say nothing. They hold each other, and then Dean flinches at the echoing\nroar that opens up behind him, at the feel of a vaccuum pulling them apart. \n\n“I wanna—fuck, Cas,” Dean whispers into the warm dip of his neck. He’s crying again. God,\nhe just—he just—“I wanna keep you.”\n“You have me,” Cas murmurs. “Dean, you have me, for the rest of your life. I will meet you\nsoon, and I will love you, and I’ll be yours at the end.”\nDean knows the right thing to do is to let Cas go. \nBut goddamnit—for once in his life, he wishes he could be truly selfish. \nThey turn around together.\nThere’s a portal in the middle of the field, a swirling vortex of yellow-white light that Dean\nhas to lift a hand against. Dean and Sam stand a few paces away, their own eyes squinted\nagainst the blaze. \nIt’s time. \n“Sammy,” Dean says. His voice is wrecked. “I love you, little brother.”\nSam’s face crumples a little when he smiles, but smile he does. “I love you too, Dean,” he\nsays. \nOther Dean next. \nHe stands with his hand raised in Cas’s direction like it’s taking everything within him not to\ngrip Cas and yank him through, and Dean can only respect that. Dean can only be grateful for\nthat. \n“Dean,” he says. He waits for the other man to meet his eyes. He takes a shaking breath.\n“Thank you for taking care of them.”\nOther Dean’s gaze doesn’t waver. “Of course,” he says. \nWhen Dean turns around, Cas is smiling, even though tears run down his cheeks. He is\nbeautiful like this: here in a field in the sharp winter, his eyes red and his smile brilliant. Dean\nloves him. Dean loves him. \n“Kiss me again?” he asks, and he sounds so small when he says it. \nCas steps forward and cups his cheek, and then he echoes Other Dean: “Of course.”\nThe kiss is a knife-twist, the sweetest softest ache. Dean closes his eyes, and he keeps them\nclosed as Cas moves the kiss to his cheek. \n“I’ll see you soon, my love,” Cas whispers. He touches Dean’s forehead with two fingers.\nThere is darkness. \n \n\n*\n \nThere’s a man watching him from across the field. \nThe sun—for it must be the sun—is heat-white and brilliant behind him. It burnishes his skin,\nhis hair. For a moment Dean thinks he knows him: something about his shoulders, his eyes... \nThe wind blows. Dean blinks. The man is gone. \nChapter End Notes\ni told everybody on twitter that i was worried this chapter is very boring, since it's\nessentially just a bunch of men having conversations. i hope i proved myself wrong\nldfslk\nthank you all so much for reading! your comments have kept me going these past few\nmonths<3\nany unanswered questions may be directed toward the sequel which is going up some\ntime this summer ;) subscribe to my ao3 page for updates!\nmy twitter | my tumblr\n\nPlease drop by the Archive and comment to let the creator know if you enjoyed their work!",
